  description="Grimnir's basic corner combo. Not a safejump setup, but you should learn it first because the muscle memory for it is essential to the rest of his combo routing. Meterless, does a good chunk of damage, and sets up seals. Even without a setup, having seals up is already plenty threatening."

## Bonus Routes

These setups are either more difficult or less useful than the above setups. They still have their uses, especially if your execution is good, but you should learn them after.

<ComboCard
  title="Old Meterless Safejump"
  notation="(starter) > 214H > 2M > 236H~8 > 5H > 623H > j.22H > j.6U > j.L > 2.H (> 5U > j.H  safejump)"
  videoSrc="/video/old-route-1.mp4"
  description="This was the popular route on the release version of the game. It's pretty difficult, but it's another meterless safejump from a common starter, and the weird jump arc of the 5U leaves a little more room for ambiguity than regular safejumps."

<ComboCard
  title="Metered Safejump (rejump j.22U)"
  notation="(starter) > 214H > 5L > 5H > 236H~4 > 623H > j.H > rejump j.22U (> land > 5L whiff > jump > j.H safejump)"
  videoSrc="/video/rejump-22u-1.mp4"
  description="Alternate ender to the standard meterless safejump combo listed near the top of this page. The rejump j.22U is slightly awkward but very consistent. Strongly recommend using the skill button instead of manually inputting 22U. This ender is entirely interchangeable with the meterless ender (rejump j.H > j.22H > j.M safejump). For simplicity, any future combos that use these enders will list the meterless one, but know that you can do this one instead if you want to."

<ComboCard
  title="Metered Safejump (delay 22U)"
  notation="(starter) > 214H > 5L > 5H > 236H~4 > 623H > j.H > (delay)22U (> 5H whiff > j.H safejump)"
  videoSrc="/video/metered-delay-22u-1.mp4"
  description="Slightly more difficult version of the previous route. Its big appeal is the ambiguity in the timing. Not very useful as a safejump, but shows its true worth when we start talking about <a href='/empty-lows' class='text-grimnir-gold hover:text-grimnir-gold-bright'>empty low setups</a> because your frame advantage depends on how much you delay 22U. Earlier 22U hits are more plus."

  videoSrc="/video/metered-new-1.mp4"
  description="Pretty easy metered safejump that does very good damage compared to the mainline route. Its downside is, again, that the starter is more specific."

  title="Meterless Skyhigh Safejump"
  notation="autocombo > 623H > j.H > rejump j.H > j.214H > j.22H > j.2U > 2H > 8U (delay 8U whiff > j.H safejump)"
  videoSrc="/video/meterless-skyhigh-1.mp4"
  description="Funny highjump safejump. Unfortunately a little more difficult than it looks. You need to manually delay the second 8U or you'll land before your opponent and whiff the j.H."
/>

<ComboCard
  title="Metered Skyhigh Safejump"
  notation="(starter) > 214H > 2M > 623H > j.22H > j.38U > j.68U > j.22U (> j.268U whiff > j.H safejump)"
  videoSrc="/video/metered-skyhigh-1.mp4"
  description="Funny highjump safejump, metered edition. The convoluted dash pattern does bonus mental damage to your opponent (and your seal count). This one is actually easier than it looks. Let go of the button after the j.38U, and the j.68U will time itself. The j.268U isn't quite autotimed, but the timing is pretty lenient."

  notation="autocombo > 623H > j.H > rejump j.H > j.214H > j.22H > j.2U > 8U > j.H > 2H (> delay 5U > j.H safejump)"
  videoSrc="/video/zipper-1.mp4"
  description="Up-down-up-down-up-down. Very fun meterless safejump. You need to delay the 5U cancel out of 2H until one of the late cancel frames or your j.H will miss."
/>

<ComboCard
  title="Ball Whiff Safejump"
  notation="(starter) > 623M > j.1U > 2H > 214M > 22U > 8U > j.H > j.214H (> j.L safejump)"
  videoSrc="/video/ball-whiff-safejump.mp4"
  description="Requires a high seal already set. Looks kind of like a combo drop and sometimes baits people to panic DP."

<ComboCard
  title="Grounded Tornado Safejump"
  notation="autocombo > 236H > 5HHH (crouch) or 5MMM (standing) > 623H > j.H > 2H > 5U > j.M > j.214H > 22U (> 2L whiff > j.H safejump)"
  videoSrc="/video/grounded-tornado.mp4"
  description="You need to be close to the opponent. If you have seals set up somewhere other than the corner the 5U will ruin the combo, so sub out the ender for whatever you feel confident in making up on the spot."

<ComboCard
  title="66H Safejump"
  notation="(starter) > 214H > 5L > 623H > 5H > 236H~8 > 66H > 22U (> 5L whiff > j.H safejump)"
  videoSrc="/video/66h-fuzzy.mp4"
  description="Now we get into 66H routes. Using 66H mid-combo is pretty difficult. You need to make sure you hold forward and press dash, and *then* H. Don't press them at the same time. You also need to make sure to wait until your character can move before pressing it because you can't buffer dash attacks. Basically, the timing is hard. These are the bonus routes of the bonus routes."

<ComboCard
  title="66H Safejump But Cooler"
  notation="autocombo > 623H > j.H > rejump j.H > j.214H > 5H > 236H~8 > 66H > 22U (> 5L whiff > j.H safejump)"

  description="Bonus swag points for comboing into airball. Also tacks on a bit more damage. But if you're too far the combo will drop."

  notation="(starter) > 623M > j.1U > 5H > 236H~8 > 66H > 623H > j.H > rejump j.H (> j.22H > j.6U whiff > j.M safejump)"
  videoSrc="/video/66h-top-seal.mp4"
  description="Requires an air seal already set and you need to be close to the opponent. Doing j.2U instead of j.1U makes the combo more consistent for literally no downside, but it doesn't look as cool."
