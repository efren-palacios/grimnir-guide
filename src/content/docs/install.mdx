# Install Tech

Grimnir's install is broadly considered meme-tier, but believe it or not, it DOES give several serious and unironic advantages that can warrant pressing, especially in matchups where U skills aren't as necessary.

It opens up the ability to throw bait from anywhere, safely buffer full combos behind your lights, and move around in ways that are harder to predict. You can threaten airdash counterpoke from any position, and you can convert any hit into a corner safejump.

Install can be particularly worth pressing when the enemy is one hit from death, but super won't be enough to kill; or, when you get reset to neutral and one more confirm will win.

Combo routes that activate install in the middle. This isn't necessary, or even necessarily encouraged. You could just save your meter and pop install if you get reset to neutral - it's unpunishable as long as you aren't point-blank. But if you know you want to install in advance (for the defensive properties, or maybe just for fun) the following are several different ways to activate.

  notation="(starter) > 214H > 5L > 5H > 236H~4 > 623H > j.H > 2H (> install > j.6U > j.M safejump)"
  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/install-setup-alt.mp4"
  description="The easiest install safejump combo with the fewest restrictions. Common starter, doesn't require seal cooldown, and activates at the very end so meter is more lenient. The downsides are that the safejump costs juice directly and it doesn't set up seals, but it's a super consistent backup route if you can't route into anything better. Somewhat frequently baits a DP response because it doesn't look like a safejump."

<ComboCard
  title="Install Seal Setup Safejump"
  notation="(starter) > 214H > 2M > 236H > (delay)2H > install > 623H > j.H > rejump j.H (> j.22H > 6U whiff > j.M safejump)"
  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/install-setup.mp4"

<ComboCard
  title="623H Install Seal Setup Safejump"
  notation="(starter) > 623H > j.214H > j.22H > j.2U > 5H > 236H~8 > 2H > install > 2H (> 5U > j.H safejump)"
  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/j.214h-install.mp4"
  description="Another three seal safejump route. Broadly similar to the previous combo (in outcome, not in routing) - in this one, you need your seal cooldown even sooner, but can afford to wait until the end to build the meter. The starter being more specific is the main downside, so you have even fewer opportunities to route into it."
/>

Sets up zero seals, so you should favor other routes in general, but if you don't have the cooldown this is slightly better than the first route listed because it doesn't cost any juice for the safejump.

Do 236H~4 > delay 5U for the safejump, 236H (no followup) > instant 5U for the empty low. If you have seals setup elsewhere the 5U will send you off on a grand adventure, so you'll need to spend the juice for 8U/9U instead. The timing is the same.

<ComboCard
  title="Install Seal Tornado Setup"
  notation="(starter) > 214H > 2M > 623H > j.22H > j.9U > (delay) j.2U > 2H > install > 2H (> 236L~4)"
  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/tornado-install.mp4"
  description="Install tornado setup, particularly useful against parry characters. Unfortunately it's also the most difficult route on this list - the j.22H and 9U2U timings are very awkward. Not so hard that you can't hit it in a match, but hard enough that you can drop it."

  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/install-midscreen.mp4"
  description="The only midscreen install combo you need to know. Takes you corner-to-corner with only two dashes, AND it's a safejump setup. Need to delay the 623H dynamically based on distance to corner. Don't do more 6U > autocombo repetitions than you need to reach the corner - if you do too many, you'll get pushed out of range of autocombo and drop. Also, if you're too close to the corner, 236H will only hit twice and the combo will drop. At closer ranges, you can just do the standard corner bnb (listed next)."

Meme combos with extremely varying degrees of practicality.

  title="Install Corner Steal"
  notation="(starter) > 214H > 5L > 5H > 236H~4 > 623M > j.1U > f.L (> 6U whiff > 2L)"
  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/install-corner-steal.mp4"
  description="Funny corner steal. Reactable, but most people aren't ready for Grimnir to steal the corner and are not holding the block button so it hits a decent amount. You're +3 so even if they react they can't mash. Can also occasionally bait a reversal by crossing up the opponent's input. Fairly easy to execute since the muscle memory transfers directly from the standard meterless safejump route. You can also go into this from the standard install midscreen route, which is shown in the latter half of the video."

  description="Install-exclusive midscreen safejump. Unfortunately it spends three juice just for the setup, does poverty damage, and doesn't even carry to the corner. Effectively zero merit. But if you know it'll kill anyway, you can swag on them with this."

  description="Even cooler install-exclusive safejump route. This one spends FOUR juice for the setup, which definitely means it must be better, yup.  Again, zero merit. You could have just taken them to the corner instead. But isn't having zero merit kind of a merit in itself?"
