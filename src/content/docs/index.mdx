## Notation Guide

### Granblue Combo Basics

Granblue's "combo limit" system only kicks in after the opponent is launched, so as long as the opponent is grounded you can do as many hits as you can fit in without it affecting the launcher portion of the combo. As a result you'll usually see combos start with **(starter)** because, well, it actually doesn't matter. Some common **(starter)**s:

- autocombo
- f.H
- 2L > 2L > f.L
- c.L > 5HHH
- 5MMM > gale dash > 5MMM > gale dash > 5MMM
- f.H

### Special Input Translation

For people that use skill button (that's me):

- **236X** is tornado
- **214X** is kick
- **623X** is spin
- **22X** is seal set
- **j.22X** is air seal set
- **j.214X** is air ball
- **XU** is seal dash in the X direction
- **j.XU** is air seal dash in the X direction

### Numpad Notation

What do the numbers mean? It's called "numpad notation" and they represent directions. **2** is down, **6** is forward, **4** is backward. Grimnir's combo notation is extra fun because you get to use stuff like **7** and **9** for some combos. Most characters don't get to do that. Grimnir privilege.

For tornado specifically you'll see **"236H~X"**. This is to denote the tornado followup. **236H~8** is up tornado. **236H~4** is stop tornado.

### Rejumps

You'll also see **"rejump"** in some combos. This means to land, jump again, and do the input. Another thing most characters in this game don't get to do, but you're playing a cool character so you get to do the cool stuff.

### Fuzzies

What is the fuzzy? Without getting into the inner workings, it's hitting a falling jump attack, and then hitting a second jump attack while rising for a sort of "double overhead." You might see it in old gameplay videos, but fuzzies as a concept were entirely removed in version 2.10 and you can no longer perform them.

### Frame Meter

The Street Fighter 6-style frame meter at the bottom of each video is a mod: [gbvsr-frame-meter](https://github.com/agersant/gbvsr-frame-meter). Not necessary but can help you figure out what you're doing wrong.
