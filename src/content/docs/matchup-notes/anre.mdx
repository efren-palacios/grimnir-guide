  notes={["In traditional Granblue zoner fashion, Anre has access to a billion plus frames that make defense obnoxious. He gets some bonus points that make this matchup quite annoying for us. Let's go over his specials one at a time.", "First, spear laser. This is his \"default\" projectile. It has bonus priority and will beat tornado straight up instead of trading, so don't bother with stop tornado in this matchup.", "- The light one fires a laser forward. Minus on block, can be rolled, though your frame advantage is actually better if you just block it instead.", "- The medium one is very slow, but it's plus on block. It can also be rolled, though unless you roll it earlier than you expect you won't really be plus. Can be better to mash. Or dodge. Dodging is still better than giving him giant plus frames for free.", "- The heavy one is fast and plus on block. You are minus on dodge. Basically, he gets free plusframes with no counterplay.", "Second, spear spin. This is a pseudo-stance move with various followups. On defense, you'll only really see EX spear spin for the light followup.", "- The medium followup is a spear slam. This is minus, and pointblank it's punishable with 2M.", "- The heavy followup hops on his spear like a surfboard. It's very punishable on block. He only really uses it for combos, though if he misinputs it be ready to punish him.", "- The U followup is a dash. He might use this to try to skip neutral sometimes, but it's reactable, so you can kill him for it if you're ready.", "- The light followup fires a spear. Out of EX spear spin, this is plus, and it's also a true blockstring. Basically, he gets free plusframes with no counterplay.", "Third, other... spear spin? The one where anre himself rotates with the spear.", "- On the ground, light, medium, and heavy are all minus. In fact, heavy is punishable on block.", "- In the air, light is minus. Medium is very slow but if you let him do it he's plus. Heavy is fast and plus. You'll see the heavy air spin often as a throwbait; you can beat it with fuzzy mash 5M, though 5M is 7f so it's weaker to traditional stagger pressure.", "- In the air, the U variant is minus.", "- On the ground, the U variant is plus, and he can true blockstring into it. Basically, he gets free plusframes with no counterplay.", "Fourth, he has a parry reversal. The frustrating part of this move is that it wallbounces on hit. So, this character is plus forever, and then when he stops being plus, he can press parry, and if you swing into it he gets a full combo. Because he has a parry, we can't safejump him on offense either. His U parry is also a bit of a knowledge check - you have to dodge the projectile followup he does then punish. If you block the projectile, you're minus.", "He can also parry in response to projectiles to dash in and skip neutral. His M parry is safe on block from far ranges, but he is always minus, so be ready to take your turn.", "He also has a regular parry. The timing window is quite small. You'll mostly see him do the air variant to try and beat your antiairs. You can actually special cancel if you swing into it - so if you 2H him and he parries, you can cancel into DP and he has to parry again or he gets hit. Unfortunately this costs us 50%. You can cancel into M DP instead; this will lose to divekick, but the reward for him on hit isn't very high so it's okay to just accept losing to divekick because winning is much more rewarding for us than it is for him. Alternatively you can wait for him to land; if he pressed air parry, he's punishable on landing. Basically, air parry is RPS that is in your favor. Once you've represented that you can deal with it you'll see it a lot less.", "In this matchup, you should react to the U skill flash with roll. He does not have any U skills that punish roll, but he does have one that punishes spotdodge.", "66L: Goes under airdash.", "Airdash on block: Has a parry.", "Throwtech RPS: His f.M and f.H are so slow that they unintuitively beat both f.H and 2M. If you press f.M instead of f.H, throwtech RPS in this matchup is regular.", "Supers: SBA is a good reaction super. SSBA is quite slow; it will beat tornado, but isn't a great reaction against other things, so you may not see it as much on reaction. Both can be spotdodged. Spotdodge SBA twice in a row as quickly as possible. Spotdodge SSBA only once; the hitbox disappears much much earlier than the visual.", "He also has an install. He summons seven bits that automatically follow up some of his buttons on hit or block. He has two main ways to abuse this in neutral.", "1) Sweep. When spaced, his sweep becomes plus on block during install and leads to a combo on hit. Try not to exist at the plus sweep spacing.", "2) Spear dive. This is always plus on block during install. It's also fairly slow and has a shallow angle, so you can antiair it somewhat reliably, or just back off and make him whiff."]}
