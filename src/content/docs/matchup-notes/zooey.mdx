  notes={["Beware 66H (the shield charge) in neutral. It's safe if she spaces it optimally, but often you can get a f.H punish on block. Between shield charge, airspin, and U dragon, airdash generally kind of sucks in this matchup. Plan to play a more grounded game.", "Looks misleading, but U dragon is punishable on spotdodge with U kick.", "Spotdodge her U DP on the way down for a guaranteed close punish - if you block, you'll often get a f.H punish instead.", "Try to react to EX airspin with 2H for a full punish. As of patch 2.20, it's minus on block, so even if you block it you're still in a good position. M spin is even and L spin is minus - can mash 5L on both of them, but be ready for a clash situation after M spin.", "Plan to block a lot on defense while you wait for her to deplete her dragon meter. Many of her dragon moves are either plus or a spacing trap on spotdodge, so the r/r for dodging isn't great. If you see her tap charge on offense, take your turn back with 66L or try to get her off you with 236U - 2U won't reach in time to punish.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular.", "Throwtech RPS: Her 2M is an omnipotent throw tech button. Can walk back because it isn't a low, but it will often reach anyway.", "Supers: Her SBA is a great antiair and her SSBA is a great reaction super. Be wary of both. Both can be spotdodged."]}
