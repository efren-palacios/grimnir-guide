  notes={["Lucilius's gimmick is that his cooldowns start out disastrously long, but over the course of the round he'll build up \"blade levels\" to a maximum of 5 that progressively shorten the cooldowns. At blade level 5 he also gains a new combo route out of his lunging hitgrab special that kills you if it hits.", "Starting with the big knowledge check in this matchup: the teleport. Three variants.", "- Light teleport is sort of like an empty jump. No followup. It is still punishable if you mash!", "- Medium teleport puts out a hitbox shortly after it arrives. The followup is minus on block. However, on counterhit it wallbounces for a full combo in the corner.", "- Heavy teleport warps him into the air and he smashes down into the ground for a full combo on hit anywhere on screen. If you 2H him, he dies.", "There is an OS you can do with 66L that will beat all three of these teleports for a full punish if you press it shortly after he disappears. It will punish the light teleport, counterhit the medium one before its hitbox comes out, and sneak behind the heavy teleport. However the timing is very strict, the reaction in a real match is pretty difficult, and screwing it up can be quite costly. If you don't feel confident in the 66L OS, you have two other good options.", "1) Spend 50% for the DP. This is the safest option for dealing with teleport, but it costs 50%.", "2) Wait. The medium teleport is minus on block and the heavy teleport is reactable with 2H. If he does the light teleport, let him get away with the plus frames. Basically, give up on one of the options. Not preferable, but easier to execute.", "His U teleport is plus on block, but you can mash him out of it on reaction with 5L for a full punish, similar to Narmaya's U flip.", "Once you've represented that you can deal with teleport in neutral, you'll mostly start to see it as a throwbait. Be careful hard-teching throws against this character. You'll also see it if you overrepresent tornado in neutral.", "His fireball also has very distinct variants.", "- The light one sends a disc slowly across the screen. It is easily spotdodged or rolled; you won't be plus on this roll, but you won't be punishable either.", "- The medium one puts a disc in front of him for a bit. It is giga-plus on block. It can also be rolled, but the timing is pretty tight and it isn't reactable so it's a hard call out for you. Generally you will be giving him the plus frames from this - challenging isn't worth it.", "- The heavy one puts a disc in front of him for a very long time. You'll see this variant mostly on oki because it's extremely slow for blockstrings. If you see a Lucilius try to press this in regular offense, you can react with sweep. This variant cannot be spotdodged or rolled.", "- The ultimate one is very similar to the light one, but gives a ton of frame advantage on block. Definitely roll this! If you block he's in for free! Well, \"free.\" He spent. But you get it.", "The big thing to be aware of with regard to fireball in this matchup is that he can't press it for free. His U fireball can be rolled. The other variants are all quite slow - you can easily punish with U tornado > U kick on reaction in neutral for a full combo.", "His DP has, you guessed it, three variants (excluding U which is just a traditional metered DP).", "- One is just a downswing. This is punishable. You won't see it.", "- One is just an upswing. This is punishable, but you will see it sometimes because of the next bullet.", "- One is an upswing, and then a downswing. This one is safe on block. If you spotdodge the downswing, you get a full punish. But if you spotdodge and he did the previous upswing-only variant, you die instead. It's risky RPS. If you're in a bad spot in the round, you can play the RPS; if you're in a good spot, don't bother.", "He also has a stance where he readies his swords and stares at you menacingly. The main reason for Lucilius to press this is that it passively generates blade levels for him. He has, yup, three followups.", "- He sends a sword forward. Minus but safe.", "- He sends a sword forward, then brings it back. This is plus on block.", "- He swings his sword down.", "Airdash goes over the first two options, but a sufficiently ready Lucilius can swat you out of the air with the last option so it can be difficult to approach traditionally. Tornado is a fairly safe way to get him out of stance when he presses like this.", "Lucilius's charging special is pretty much the same no matter the version. It charges forward, it's safe on block, and it leads to a full combo only if he has blade level 5. It's quite fast and goes quite far so Lucilius players will occasionally throw it out in neutral to try and get lucky. The direct damage he gets on hit may not be that high, but this move generates the most blade meter for him, so it's still a desirable hit for him. Try not to give it to him for free.", "His f.M is a very strong button. It is 7f when you're close, 9f at max range, and quite difficult to whiff punish. This is generally Lucilius's choice of button when cornered, and it's pretty difficult to space around, so backing off against him in the corner is weaker than usual.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular.", "Throwtech RPS: His sweep is an omnipotent throwtech button and cannot be backwalked if the throw is initiated pointblank (thanks proximity guard).", "Supers: His SBA has two variants. One fires a big blast instantly. It has normal SBA iframes and will beat tornado, etc. His second variant lets him fire up to three blasts before the big blast. He can mix up the timing, which makes it annoying to spotdodge. But it has no iframes so you won't see it as a reversal - he'll use it more as an antiair or fullscreen punish tool. SSBA has much much worse range than it looks and is a mediocre reaction super. It can be spotdodged."]}
