  notes={["Airdash is really good against both projectiles and stance, but it is punishable on block.", "Can spotdodge the palm stance followup. Spotdodge loses to the slash projectile followup, but the reward on hit is low for him - whereas you can roll the slash followup, but then you lose to palm which has much higher reward. Safest play is to just block, which leaves you even but his buttons are better so it's RPS in his favor.", "Has a throw/DP setup with water in the corner. Rare hit for him but can be scary so be aware.", "If he has an element his H charge gives him free plus frames. Either try to stop him from taking an element in neutral or try to play out of the range where he can press charge and bully with tornado.", "His wind stance gives him access to an airdash, but it sucks compared to ours, and he takes a billion more damage for it, so if he ever does it you can just 2H and murder him.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Punished by 9f DP.", "Throwtech RPS: 2M is an omnipotent throwtech button. If you initiate the throw, you can walk back and whiff punish.", "Supers: SBA is a decent reaction super that beats all forms of tornado. SSBA is a matchup-defining reaction super that hits fullscreen on frame 15. Careful sending tornados or moving in the air when he has it. Both can be spotdodged. Fullscreen SSBA is punishable with 214U on dodge."]}
