  notes={["Try not to exist at the spacing where he can press his charge move and be plus. Either back up farther to play at fullscreen, or approach to play at midscreen. Be ready to antiair. On offense, 623M is good for stopping him from walljumping out of the corner. Remember that the second hit of his DP is an overhead for some reason. Remember to hold the block button.", "Dealing with rekka: He doesn't really get much reward off it on standing hit so the risk/reward on mashing 5L when you see it is often very favorable. Lance players like to do the first hit of EX rekka into throw, and if you're mashing you'll beat them for a full combo. But don't mash a low, because he's +5 on crouching counterhit and gets a full combo! Make sure to mash 5L. The first hit of his light/medium rekka can be plus when spaced.", "You can react to his EX fireball in neutral with U fireball, and on defense with f.H for a full punish. It is slower and an easier reaction than it looks. His U fireball inflicts a unique slowing debuff for a bit that makes anything you whiff turn into instant death. It's a true blockstring out of c.H so he can force you to hold it. Don't BC, and if you have the health, take the throw.", "He has a setup where he does EX fireball into invincible teleport dive. You'll see it most often after SBA. The idea is if you jump the EX fireball, he hits you with the dive into full combo. Unfortunately for him, the invincible teleport isn't invincible on startup and loses to air ball, so you can just jump and press air ball to deal with the setup. (Be aware that he can still antiair you normally! Don't rely on this too much.)", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular.", "Throwtech RPS: His 2M is also a 6f light and will clash with ours. Default otherwise.", "Supers: SBA is a very good reaction super, be aware. SSBA is also decent but loses to stop fireball. Both can be spotdodged."]}
