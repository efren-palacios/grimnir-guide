  notes={["Has great options for dealing with our airdash in 5U and H kick, so lean harder on your ground game.", "He can reset pressure infinitely with his many plus specials. Delay mash on defense with 2M to keep Soriz players honest. The timing is hard, so you may need to practice. Other than that, either accept that he'll be plus often or say farewell to your bravery points.", "The H rapid punches and H ground smash are both plus. The H dash punch is minus and you can safely challenge with 2M. The M rapid punch is -1, but he can frametrap with his H kick special (it's 5f for some reason) to beat any attempt to challenge so be wary - if you block the H kick you get a full punish with 2M > 236H~8.", "Be ready to spotdodge U dash punch in neutral and on offense, U ground slam on defense. Be scared of teching throws when he has 50%.", "Dealing with 5U in neutral: you're playing RPS in his favor. He can hold it for a variable amount of time much longer than you would expect, and the recovery isn't punishable on reaction. If you just run up and try to throw he will often cancel into f.M. You can try to space around f.M, but even if you bait it it's a difficult whiff punish, and if you press on prediction it's as likely he'll whiff punish you instead. Try to play around your ground seals so that at least if you win the interaction you can convert with sealdash to make the reward on hit worth it. If you have 100 meter, you can also super.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Can punish with H kick.", "Throwtech RPS: 2M is an omnipotent throwtech button. You can walk back and whiff punish with 2M.", "Supers: SBA is an okay reaction super. Beats all tornado followups except stop tornado. SBA can be spotdodged. You must spotdodge twice, or block the second hit.", "His SSBA activates his install. While in install, he takes significantly reduced damage, further reduced by the number of times you swung into his 5U. It doesn't spend his meter, so he keeps his U skills, and he gets a new SSBA. While in install:", "- His rapid punch gains a new followup. It guard breaks for a full combo even on block. If you get guard broken by this, you must BC! But you can avoid ever getting hit by it if you mash as soon as you see him start this move, because it loses to mash.", "- Unfortunately he has a second followup that beats mash! But it's punishable on block. It sounds like you're guessing between his guard break followup and this frametrap followup, but he can't leave much of a gap when cancelling into this one, so if you slightly delay your mash you'll win every time. This leaves you vulnerable to him not cancelling into anything, but that's life.", "- He gets a new SSBA. This is the really scary part of his install. This SSBA is an invincible 0f command grab super, so you cannot block, spotdodge, roll, or mash on it. You must jump or backdash it on prediction. Also means you can't really safejump him while he's in install."]}
