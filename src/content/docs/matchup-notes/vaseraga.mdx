  notes={["Vaseraga has a self-buff move that gives the next several uses of one of his \"big\" moves armor. Vas players really really want this armor because he sucks without it. Can react to him setting up armor in neutral with 214U. If he is armored and enters stance/charge from fullscreen you can knock him out with H or U fireball. Your goal is to stop him from setting up armor, or, once he's set up, to hit him out with U fireball and take advantage of the knockdown. If you let him set up armor and do as he pleases you will lose.", "He can bait BC with Armor and full punish you for it, so be careful pressing BC while he has has armor charge.", "He has a weird advancing stance. It has five followups.", "- A very (very) long-ranged low. Hits you even when you think you're outspacing it.", "- A high that whiffs on crouchers. Whiffing on crouchers is actually a good thing for him because it is extremely difficult to react to this whiff. If you aren't confident in your reactions, you should treat him as plus on whiff.", "- A command grab. He has two variants - one that is unreactable but can only be used pointblank, and one that is reactable but can be used from farther out.", "- He slams the hilt of his scythe into the ground. This has unlimited armor! If you try to super Vaseraga, he can press this to completely armor through your super and kill you for it. Don't press super when Vaseraga is in stance. If you're desperate to reversal, DP instead, since he can't react to it - he has to guess with this followup instead.", "- He swings his scythe down. This is the gimmick followup. He can charge it, and if he fully charges it, it guardbreaks for a full combo. You must spotdodge! If you forget to spotdodge, you can still BC out of the guardbreak to avoid instantly losing the game.", "- Technically there's a sixth followup where he just keeps walking forward. If he walks forward forever, you can grab him out of it, though it's risky against him doing something other than walking forward forever.", "He can also do the command grabs outside of stance (and will, often). Same rule applies - if he's pointblank, you're guessing; past that, you can react. (It is a hard reaction.)", "Speaking of command grabs, his reversal is his U grab. It is fully invulnerable, but also slower than most U skills, which makes it uniquely safejabbable. Poor Vaseraga. This only applies if you're actually ready to react, though. He can also go through safejumps with this, but if you react you get a full punish, so just another thing you need to be ready for.", "His U shoulder charge gains full armor on frame 5. He can't mash it out of tight blockstrings or on safejumps, but if you leave a gap, or on his own minus frames, he might mash it to try and get lucky because he gets a full combo on hit. If you swing into it, you're getting hit. If you spotdodge it you can always get your maximum punish, but if you block it you have to settle for 2M > 236H~8.", "You can also spotdodge the M and L shoulder charges. They are both plus when spaced, so Vaseraga will try to bully his way in with these in neutral. He can also do them to take oki midscreen; you can't spotdodge these, so just hold the frames. You can also spotdodge H charge, but it always leaves him minus, so you don't really need to.", "ALWAYS BE READY FOR U FIREBALL. U fireball is a matchup-defining move. Plus on block, full combo on hit. Like U charge, Vas players WILL throw it out randomly to try and get lucky, but unlike U charge there's not really any risk for them so you'll see it much more often. Also beware that U fireball hits higher than you expect - you cannot airdash over it. You aren't necessarily plus on dodge depending on spacing and how fast you react, but dodging always leaves you in a better position than blocking (or getting hit).", "His last U skill is U stomp which has a bunch of armor. If you spotdodge the first two stomps you get a full punish but it's kind of annoying so you'll need to practice it.", "Airdash on block: j.L wins against everything except SSBA, which is a parry. Be ready to react to U grab.", "Throwtech RPS: 2M will beat any regular button he tries to press, though if he waits he can whiff punish it. His U charge can blow up anything we press for high reward, so keep that in mind before doing anything rash while he has the 50.", "Supers: Both supers can be spotdodged. His SBA is a mediocre reaction super. It can go through most tornados, but loses to stop tornado. His SSBA is also a mediocre reaction super due to its poor horizontal range, but it has a guardpoint! If you hit into it, you can cancel into spotdodge, which is great - but if you hit with something that is not spotdodge-cancellable, he'll kill you for it. This includes safejumps! You cannot safejump Vaseraga while he has SSBA."]}
