  notes={["Lariat is very fast in neutral but punishable if you crouch, so be wary of standing around too much.", "On round start, walk back. If she runs forward or does lariat, be ready to duck and check it. Otherwise start throwing tornados and setting up seals.", "Ladivas enjoy jumping on top of our seals and mashing the bellyflop. It is difficult to antiair with Grimnir's 2H and 623M, but a well-timed 623L can antiair.", "On offense, lean on stagger pressure and emphasize throws. You want to avoid eating a counterhit BC. Also, her reversal (U headbutt) loses to throws. Be aware of her mashing 2U and 2M. 2M has more range than you expect and confirms into U lariat. 2U is punishable on block, but it's fast and her strong strike/throw game gives it more reward on hit than most characters so you'll see it a lot.", "Her U headbutt is a \"parry\" so it can't be safejumped - use tornado setups instead. It's also safe on block, so if you want a punish you need to spotdodge the U flash.", "If she has 50, don't press backdash in neutral because the moment you do she'll press U lariat and get lucky. She might also buffer it out of 2M instead. Make sure you spotdodge U lariat! It's an easier reaction than most U skills and gives a full punish.", "Her headbutt eats projectiles and gives her meter, but our ability to mix up tornado followups makes it pretty difficult for her to time it in this matchup.", "On defense: many Ladivas will do one hit of EX headbutt into 66L. 5L mash wins here, though it will lose to her pressing 5L instead. If she does all three hits of EX headbutt it's punishable with throw. Headbutt is also the safest place for you to press brave counter in this matchup. Her command grabs don't do as much damage as similar characters from other games, so don't be too afraid to take some throws.", "If she does a safejump while on 100 meter there are decent odds she'll do empty jump > super, so keep fuzzy jump/fuzzy backdash/fuzzy DP in mind as an option, or fuzzy DP. If she doesn't have 100 regular fuzzy mash will beat most empty jumps (technically loses to U headbutt, beware).", "Her U air grab is completely invulnerable. It can be hard for her to hit us with it, but be aware.", "66L: WINS AGAINST AIRDASH.", "Airdash on block: Has a U skill parry. Super also wins, beware.", "Throwtech RPS: Default.", "Supers: She has a good reaction super but stop tornado actually beats it, so if you want to keep pressing tornado in neutral while she's on 100 you should favor stop tornado. She also has two command grab supers which behave pretty much the same. If you aren't already jumping or backdashing when you see the flash, you're scooped. Notably this means taking any meaningful oki (safejump, tornado setup) against Ladiva while she's on 100 meter is gambling with half your lifebar. The regular super can be spotdodged. The command grabs, obviously, cannot."]}
