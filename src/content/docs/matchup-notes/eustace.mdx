  notes={["Airdash is really good against his fireball but don't recklessly press it while he has bouncyball cooldown.", "Can spotdodge the jumpback-and-shoot special he does out of his dash on reaction and punish with f.M.", "All grenades can be rolled on prediction. Not on reaction - you can be very minus in his face if you wait to react. Also bouncy ball punishes prediction roll for a full combo so be wary.", "However it is still very worth spotdodging EX grenade on reaction - you're minus, but not punishable. Eustace is a much scarier character if you let him put EX grenade on you, so it's worth avoiding just for that. Make sure you're reacting to the yellow flash and not the grenade windup in general because yellow grenade beats spotdodge.", "When he has EX grenade on you, he gets a full combo out of throw. He can also throwbait with j.U. Fuzzy mash 5L and you can sometimes catch both options.", "EX fireball and EX bouncyball are both plus and he can true blockstring into them from autocombo, so if he so chooses you might be blocking for awhile. The charged (non-EX) variants of both are also plus but can be spotdodged.", "Hardest part of the matchup is when he loops bouncyball pressure in the corner. Three solutions:", "- Uncharged bouncy ball is approximately even on block. You can challenge, but be careful of him backing off and whiff-punishing with button or U gun.", "- Charged bouncy ball can be spotdodged. You're minus, but can still challenge a 66L reset with 2M.", "- Charged bouncy ball can also be swept with 2U. You will trade with the ball and knock Eustace down. You don't get a sideswap off this knockdown.", "U bouncy balls can be spotdodged but the timing is spacing-dependent. If you are point-blank, it cannot be spotdodged. If you're half a screen away, spotdodge early. If you're farther than that, you must delay the spotdodge. Successfully dodging it from halfscreen is a punish with U kick.", "U gun can also be spotdodged. Roll twice in a row for the punish. Differentiating between U bouncy balls and U gun in time to dodge is pretty much impossible, so if you don't have a good sense for which one your opponent is pressing it's safer to block.", "He broadly has four mixups he'll go for out of U grenade:", "- Triple attack high/low. You can fuzzy block this so it isn't real mix, but it's an execution check that's easy to fail. You can try to dodge the execution check with BC, but if he spotdodges you'll die.", "- Delay 66M (overhead dash attack). He needs to delay it to time with the grenade detonation, so you know when you should be looking out for it.", "- Throw. He's plus on throw tech because the grenade covers him.", "- j.U throw bait. Gives a full combo on hit, but can lose to fuzzy mash 5L.", "He can also just block and wait for us to reversal. If he gets hit, the grenade disappears, but on block it stays so don't assume you're out just because he let you mash. If you have seals up, mash > 5U can get you out of the corner before the grenade detonates.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular.", "Throwtech RPS: 2M is an omnipotent throwtech button. If you're the one to initiate the throw, you can walk back and whiff punish with 2M.", "Supers: SBA is a decent reaction super. If you stop tornado right in front of you, it will usually beat it. SSBA is an excellent antiair so be wary of jumping around your seals too much when he has it. SBA can be spotdodged, SSBA cannot - if he catches you during dash startup, you need to be close enough to roll behind him, or you're hit."]}
