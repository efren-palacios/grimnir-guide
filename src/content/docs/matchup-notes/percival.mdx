  notes={["His buttons are better and he has a great option against airdash, so neutral can be difficult to navigate. Lean harder on fireball. Try not to burn EX fireball cooldown. His fireball is extremely slow and you can trivially react with U fireball. Can also whiff punish his slower buttons (especially f.H) with 214U.", "Likes to either press f.H or back up round start to try and get early stocks. Can be decent to back off into 214M range and bully with fireballs. Alternatively, setting up seals is a trade probably in our favor.", "Flame carpet: per Dustloop, \"Flame carpet deals 1670 chip damage over 2 seconds as long as they stay on it regardless if they block or not.\" About 10% of our max health. That's significantly less than a throw, so think of it like taking the throw. If you can afford to, it's safer not to let Percival bait you into doing something stupid because of Carpet.", "Command grab: It's quite slow and leads to mediocre damage on hit, unless he has super where it becomes a very intimidating round closer. The massive startup time makes it weaker to fuzzy jump and fuzzy mash than most command grabs.", "His DP is horizontally massive, but has a much worse backward hitbox than it looks so you can often sneak behind it with airdash.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Punished by 9f DP.", "Throwtech RPS: 5L reaches from throwtech distance. You need to crouch, then stand and do a very quick f.M. Difficult to execute. Pointblank, 2M beats most of his other options including 2M and 2U. When spaced you need to back up and delay 2M instead.", "Supers: Neither super can be spotdodged because for some reason he can hold them. Also SBA becomes unblockable when fully charged (a very very long time). SSBA can be difficult to punish if he does it from halfscreen or so away. Both are slow enough to block post-flash, so as long as he doesn't catch you in the literal startup of your dash you'll have time to block."]}
