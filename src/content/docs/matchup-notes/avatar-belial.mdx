  notes={["This character will test your reactions.", "We lose neutral against Avatar Belial. His fan-of-spears projectile is very very good - it hits everywhere in front of him (including the air), and it has truly no cooldown, so Grimnir's air actions are effectively sealed. It can be rolled, though the framedata after depends on how early you roll it. Generally if you do this, you will gradually push him toward the corner, then at some point he will decide to go into the air or run in. Going into the air is reactable. Running in isn't, so I think this is the most common way you'll see neutral end (unfortunately in his favor).", "When you're stuck in the corner, he is fundamentally taking plus frames with one of two options.", "1) Rockslide. This is plus for him. He gets to reset pressure with 66L. You can spotdodge it, and then he is minus. However, if he does charged laser instead, you die for the spotdodge! You can react to laser with sweep but it frequently won't knock down from the spacing he does it (and you're minus on hit). Still better than letting him press it for free. Alternatively, uncharged laser has recovery frames and you can take your turn back with 66L. Charged laser does not have recovery frames and you cannot challenge safely after it finishes.", "2) Flight. He has many options out of flight.", "- Divekick. Plus on block. Cannot be dealt with on reaction. You can spotdodge or delay 2H on prediction but his reward for calling this out is typically the round. Generally, it's safest to just let him take the plus frames with divekick, maybe BC if you're feeling it, and instead focus your energy on dealing with his other options.", "- Grab. When you see his hand flash, he is going for the command grab. Backdash it on reaction - you often won't get the punish if you jump. Only the EX one (where his whole body glows red) will lead to a full combo on hit, so even if you fail the reaction check against the non-red variants it's not a big deal. You'll sometimes see him try to catch you sleeping with a mid-combo EX command grab reset if the combo he's doing won't be enough to kill. Pay attention even when he's hitting you.", "- Laser. He can fire the laser at a fixed angle, or hold the button to do a laser sweep. His eye glows before firing the laser which can be a little bit annoying because it looks kind of like the command grab tell. If you spotdodge the laser sweep, you get a full punish anywhere on screen with U kick.", "- Stomp. His fastest option, which he does when he wants to cancel flight. He can also safejump with it. If you're below him, it's plus on block and leads to a very high damage crouching confirm on hit. If he cancels on offense but you aren't right below him, you can take your turn back with 66L, though it's a tough reaction. If he cancels flight in neutral with this, you can kill him with U kick. He'll also use this as a throwbait sometimes - you can sometimes catch him out of the startup with fuzzy mash 5L, but I wouldn't recommend trying to react with 2H because it will frequently lose. Think carefully before teching throws because, again, his reward on hit is massive.", "Dealing with flight: I already noted the \"default\" counterplay - let him get away with divekick, focus on reacting to the rest. If he's close enough, you can also spend the meter to DP or super him. If he presses it in neutral to try and get away from you rolling his fireball, you can often run forward and M DP for a full combo.", "Dealing with his U skills: don't spotdodge in reaction to the ult skill flash. If you spotdodge his U rekka, you die. You can roll the U projectile but you need to wait long enough to confirm that it isn't U rekka first. There is no good counterplay to U rekka - it is plus on block and cannot be spotdodged. You can technically hit him out of it, but the timing is too difficult to try in a real match. Your safest option is to DP/super on reaction.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Punished by 9f DP.", "Throwtech RPS: Weirder than normal. His sweep is 10f but beats both f.H and 2M and cannot be backwalked due to proximity guard. However, it loses to our 9f f.M! f.M is usually a pretty bad throwtech option, but it can be good here if the abel player is overrelying on sweep on throwtech.", "Supers: SBA can be spotdodged. It is a good reaction super with a strong antiair hitbox and a lot of iframes, so if you're committed to something it'll probably win.", "SSBA is a 0f command grab super. This game really likes these for some reason. Unusually, it is slow enough that if you jump, you can wait until you land and still get a full punish. If you press j.H on the way down you can get clipped by the followup hitbox, so wait until you land. If you're in the corner you can also backdash it, but midscreen the followup hitbox will kill you.", "Abel players are reset addicts and will often try to sneak this in after something that looks like a combo drop, e.g. whiffed DP. The only reason to play this character is to do long combos, so always assume that Abel players have them on lock. It is never a combo drop! It is a setup! Don't fall for it! Of course he can also just run up and grab you. Sometimes you're going to get scooped, sad reality."]}
