  notes={["Defense is difficult due to his many plus frames and 5U. His sweep low-profiles both of our common pokes. Airdash is good against his fireball, but he can punish it on block with DP so don't throw it out too much.", "The little uppercut he does at the start of his M fireball destroys opposing fireballs, including stop tornado, so be ready for him to try to punish seal set with it. If you wait, you can just hit him out of the startup.", "Don't spotdodge his U kick - punish it on block with 2M. The other kicks can be plus when spaced, though when done up close they're punishable.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Punished by 9f DP.", "Throwtech RPS: Instant 2M will lose to 2M and 2U, but they don't reach so delay 2M will win. You can't backwalk 2U because of proximity guard, but as long as you don't hold crouch (this expands your hurtbox) it will whiff.", "Supers: Despite his SBA looking similar to other competent reaction supers, it's terrible and loses to any form of fireball. But his SSBA is a very good reaction super, be wary. Both can be spotdodged."]}
