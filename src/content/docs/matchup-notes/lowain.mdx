  notes={["If you hit into his parry with a special-cancellable move, you can spotdodge on reaction. You are always +2 on this dodge. 66L isn't special-cancellable so keep that in mind when structuring your pressure. On whiff, it is extremely difficult to punish - it happens very fast and recovers very quickly. Since it's a parry, it also beats some safejumps, but interestingly you can actually spotdodge sometimes, e.g. on the throw safejump. Note that the followup is unblockable! Sometimes he can press parry on a tornado set, activate it, and do an unblockable followup even if you intend to bait it, so always be ready to dodge.", "He has a sideswap dash attack. It can go over tornado, gives a combo on counterhit, and can't be punished on block, so it's pretty annoying to deal with. If he does it raw you can stuff it with 5L, but often he'll find a gap to throw out one of his setplay tools, then 66H to escape the corner. In these cases, the only decent option is to DP instead.", "He has three forms of Katbot setplay. The light one throws a couple punches. You'll mostly see this after throw as a pseudo \"safejump\" similar to our tornado setup. The medium one fires a laser that beats pretty much every projectile. You have to spotdodge it. The heavy one fires a bunch of missiles. The missiles don't go away if the bot gets hit and a few of them tend to stick around even if you respond with U tornado, so it kind of tends to win neutral for him once it's out. You can try to get around it with air seals or airball, but the best counterplay is to keep the pressure on in neutral so he doesn't get a chance to press it. Throw fireballs. 214M. 66L. We want to stop Lowain from doing his dumb setplay stuff, even if it costs us *our* dumb setplay stuff.", "The M, H, and U versions of his rapid slash special are all punishable (but irritating to remember). Punish M with 5H, H with 5L, and U with 2M > 236H~8. The L version is throw-punishable pointblank, but he'll tend to do it spaced. When spaced it is plus! Beware. Even if it isn't plus, he may try to keep his turn with something like 2M that low-profiles many of our buttons. Mash 2M instead to beat him.", "His other setplay tool is The Boys. The sliding one hits low, but the bellyflopper does not hit high. In neutral, seal dash will tend to beat both the boys and Lowain. Kick also often tends to beat both - 214M can be a good way to bully your way in, though he can react with parry if he's ready. You'll see three common options off this setplay:", "1) Activate the boy(s), then throw you. He can loop this, or he can activate the boy and shimmy you.", "2) Activate the boys, then instantly jump and come down with an aerial. The low always hits first, so block the first boy low then switch high. Remember that his flutter kicks are a multihitting high so you may need to hold high longer than you expect. You can also DP this setup if you're ready.", "3) Activate the boys, then bait your reversal. The boys will give him plus frames to restart his pressure.", "Ultimate Boys isn't a setplay tool - it's a matchup-warping fireball, The Wheel. Once it comes out, it stays out, even on hit, so Lowain players will press this if you give them any corner space, and they will get plus frames for it. If Lowain is close, you cannot spotdodge! He is so plus that he gets a punish with 66L. He truly gets plus frames off this. You have two main ways to play around The Wheel:", "1) Keep the pressure on. The boys don't appear until frame 6, so if you're constantly attacking he won't get a chance to Call The Boys. Unfortunately, this will naturally open you up to parry.", "2) Back off significantly. If you're far enough away, you can spotdodge the boys without repercussions and put him out 50 meter.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Has a parry.", "Throwtech RPS: Default.", "Supers: He has two fundamentally different supers, and knowing the counterplay to them will define your ability to play this matchup.", "SBA, human pyramid: This is his reversal super, and it's pretty much the best reversal super in the game. You will see this a lot. There are a number of different counterplay philosophies.", "1) The low is slower than the high, so block high and react to the low.", "2) Block high, react and spotdodge the low. Lets you avoid some chip, but he can spotdodge to try and bait out your own spotdodge and punish. Personally I think this is harder and don't recommend it.", "3) Fuzzy block high/low. This completely removes the need to distinguish the visual tells, but the execution is more difficult. 4f fuzzy window.", "Punishing the SBA can be difficult. There are two ways he can end it. He can either do a charge that guardbreaks you, or he can do nothing and hop off when time runs out. The guardbreak, despite how it sounds, is minus. If he is pointblank, he is -6 and you can punish with 2M > 236H~8. If he is spaced, it is safe! He might press parry here so be ready. If you spotdodge the charge, you can always get the punish, but if he doesn't do the charge and just hops off instead he'll get away with it, so it can be annoying RPS. If you have 100 meter yourself, you can press super just as the timer ends to punish guaranteed.", "His SSBA, also known as mario party, is a much bigger knowledge check where he summons a giant lady. It is not invulnerable frame 1 so he can't use it as a reversal. You will not see it as often. But if you don't know how to deal with it he will absolutely steal rounds from you. He has four different attacks:", "- Unblockable lava carpet. You must spotdodge this.", "- Triple rock pillar. You can technically react to her raising her arms and spotdodge this, but it's hard. I recommend thinking of this is the unreactable one.", "- Energy ball. She can hold this to throw off your dodge timing.", "- Lightning pillar. Big delay and a lot of chip. Despite how it looks, it can also be spotdodged, but the timing is later than you think. You'll need to practice it.", "In general, you want to move forward! And the Lowain player wants to push you back. If you are right up in his face he will probably press rock pillars to push you back. When he pushes you back, he'll either charge up ball or press lightning pillar. Lightning pillar has a vacuum effect, but you can outrun it!", "Note that charged ball from far enough away will give Lowain an unblockable with lava carpet. This is your biggest incentive to push forward. You don't want to get unblockabled.", "If you're right in Lowain's face when the super ends, you can punish with a button. If you're farther back, you can press U kick right before it ends to punish from fullscreen instead.", "Lowain's supers are at their scariest when you are low on health. It is very difficult to avoid chip from them entirely. Win the round convincingly so you don't have to worry about it!"]}
