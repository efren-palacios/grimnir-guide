  notes={["Very unique matchup. When Nier has the puppet, she has access to a lot of plus frames and a very strong offensive game. But the puppet costs stocks, and when she unsummons the puppet or it gets hit, it goes away until the stocks recharge to full, during which she has basically no offense, combo potential, or special moves. Very off-and-on character.", "The puppet is a knowledge check. She can queue up a series of puppet commands and they will execute consecutively. If she queues up a bunch of specials in a row, you can actually pay attention to her card to know which specials she's doing, though knowing which specials doesn't make quite as much of a difference as you might expect. Know your mash points. She has four different types of puppet special.", "- She sends the puppet forward.", "- The puppet does a flurry of slashes.", "- The puppet does a fast uppercut.", "Generally, each special has a fast variant which you can mash after and a slow variant which you cannot mash after (though you can mash the slow variants before they become active). However, she can frametrap after the fast variants with the fast uppercut special. If you get hit by this frametrap it's a full combo, so challenging carries inherent risk.", "If you see her do fast special > uppercut, you can hit the puppet with 5L to get it out of there; there's no followup she can do that frametraps after the fast uppercut. However! If it's late enough in the string or off any of the very delayed variants of her specials, Nier can recover in time to hit you out of your button here. In this case you don't really have any choice but to hold the plus frames.", "Also, her rapid slash followup is always plus and you can never mash after it, even the fast variant.", "She can throw the puppet while in the air. It flies forward then falls down on you. She can frametrap with the fast uppercut here just like any other puppet special, but it's quite slow, so you can easily approach her and get behind the puppet. If you have 50%, you can also U kick for a full punish. She has landing recovery, so you don't need to hit antiair, making the timing pretty easy.", "There is an option that beats EVERY puppet followup: brave counter. Brave counter is a nightmare for Nier. You get out of puppet pressure for free (well, it's not free at all actually, but y'know), and if she's in the middle of inputting a followup you can even get a punish for it. Note that if the puppet is spaced a bit away from you, BC whiffs and you get punished, so make sure to only press when the puppet is on top of you.", "In general, do not spotdodge puppet pressure. You're pretty much always minus on dodge and you will die.", "Nier has a very unique dash attack. It sideswitches AND hits overhead. Obviously, she can combo out of this off many setups. You must be ready to block it. Hold the block button, stand up, block. She can also corner steal with it, so don't assume you're safe just because there's a wall behind you. The puppet followup can make her plus on block, but if you BC her she's now stuck in the corner with no death so it's risky for her. She might also throw it out when you're one hit from death to try and steal the round. If you block it raw like this, you get a full punish with 5L.", "Her U skills all make her puppet invulnerable on startup, meaning you can't hit it. She cannot cancel into U skills from other puppet specials! They must be the start for a puppet string.", "- U rapid slashes. Giga-plus and BC safe, lets Nier do pretty much anything she wants to you.", "- U spin/charge. The puppet spins three times while advancing. The puppet is invulnerable for the whole duration, so Nier will throw this out in neutral sometimes. It is easy to roll on reaction. If you block it, she gets to start her turn, so definitely try to roll it.", "- U claw rake. Fast, and has more range than you would expect. This is a strong defensive option for Nier if you give her enough space. In particular, stopping tornado in front of her in the corner is futile because you will get full punished by this move. You can spotdodge it, but you're minus so be careful when trying to take your turn back. Spotdodging is still preferable to blocking it.", "- U uppercut. This is her reversal. If you block it she dies. Note that it is a parry, so it beats safejumps.", "66L: Goes under airdash.", "Airdash on block: U skill and SSBA both parry.", "Throwtech RPS: Her sweep is slow and will beat both 2M and f.H, but it loses to f.M. Otherwise regular.", "Supers: Her SBA summons a giant pillar on top of the puppet, or next to Nier if puppet isn't on screen yet. Despite how it looks it can be spotdodged. It has a solid antiair hitbox so you might see it sometimes as an antiair super, but the horizontal range is quite bad, so unless the puppet is already on top of you she probably won't try to use it as a reaction super.", "Her SSBA is a frame 1 parry. It parries all strikes (including safejumps), but loses to throws and projectiles. It has fewer active frames than it looks.", "Also has an install. It supercharges the rate at which she recharges her death stocks in exchange for health. It looks sick, but it isn't very good, so sadly you won't see it very much."]}
