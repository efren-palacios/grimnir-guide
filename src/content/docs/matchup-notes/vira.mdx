  notes={["Vira has a pretty slow command grab that activates her install on hit. She really wants to activate install (especially for free!) so she will go for it a lot. Some common places to watch out for:", "- Autocombo -> command grab, this isn't a true combo and you can backdash out of it for a full punish", "- Grab -> summon luminiera -> command grab, can be ambiguous whether luminiera or vira hits first, appropriate response is to mash", "- Air reset -> command grab, you're high in the air so you don't see the startup of the command grab", "She can also just randomly throw it out in neutral or in blockstrings. Always be ready.", "If you get command grabbed, she can jump after. When she lands from this jump, she is plus! It is a plus empty jump. Do not fuzzy mash on the landing. She can also do her weird install double jump to try to threaten high, but this is reactable with 2H.", "On defense, she has a charging spear slam sort of thing that gives her access to infinite pressure resets. It is somewhat slow and very vulnerable to 5L mash, but if you aren't ready for it she can run her turn for a very long time off this. You'll also see Vira players try to press it in neutral or off very far pokes sometimes as a way to get in for \"free.\" In install, Vira gets a full combo on counterhit, so don't screw up the mash.", "Antiairing Vira once she enters install can be difficult because she gains the ability to airstall and mix up her air movement. Some things to note: once she enters our 2H range, she can no longer bait the 2H and also punish. Additionally, once she performs the airdash she is committed! You can absolutely 2H the airdash.", "Dealing with luminiera setplay: you'll see Vira set this up in three main situations.", "- Corner knockdown. This is strike/throw; she can bait throw with something like jump, or she can do a triple attack high/low \"mixup\" but you can always fuzzy guard it.", "- Midscreen knockdown. This is mostly just to take oki. She can hit you with her dashing low on wakeup for a combo, so make sure you're blocking low. She can also throwbait/block button check you by rolling through or jumping over you, so make sure you're holding the block button!", "- Midscreen neutral. Luminiera whiffs in close range and disappears on block, so if you quickly close the gap you can avoid it, but she can cover the set with DP so it can be difficult to challenge.", "You can punish the set up in neutral with U kick, but it's a somewhat difficult reaction.", "Vira has a bunch of very good U skills.", "- U stabs. This is plus and cannot be dodged! If she isn't in install, you can potentially challenge after depending how far she does it. In install it leaves her pointblank and you absolutely cannot challenge. It also gives a wallbounce in the corner, so she will absolutely throw it out to try and blow you up for challenging on defense. If she's standing at the awkward range where your buttons don't reach, U tornado can be a good way to try and create space.", "- U Luminiera. Fairly quick fullscreen hitscan move, similar to Cag's U spear. Most often you'll see it on crouching confirm because it combos into commandgrab. This is why you would like to avoid getting hit crouching if possible.", "- U charge. This move is a knowledge check! It hits low, then high. Block low, then block high! It's -6 so you get a full punish with 2M on block. Regular Vira can only combo on counterhit and the move only extends a bit past halfscreen, so it isn't that bad to deal with. Install Vira can combo on any hit and it now extends fullscreen. Vira players will absolutely throw this out to try and get lucky. You must be ready!", "66L: Goes under airdash.", "Airdash on block: Punished by 9f DP.", "Throwtech RPS: Her sweep is an omnipotent throwtech button. If you initiate the throw pointblank, you can't even walk back - proximity guard kicks in and you get hit low. If you initiate it spaced you can whiffpunish with delay 2M.", "Supers: Her pre-install SBA activates her install. It leads to a combo on hit, but is very punishable on block. Get used to safejabbing her on wakeup to play around it. You can spotdodge it if she catches you in a dash, but you'll miss the punish so block it if possible. It hits all around her, so she can and will attempt to use it as an antiair occasionally to blow up dash patterns. If you bait it like this, you can usually punish with U kick."]}
