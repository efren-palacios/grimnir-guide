  notes={["Defense is hard. If your reactions are good you can watch for butterfly and take your turn back with 66L. If she just loops f.L > 66L and arrows you'll need to find a place to mash and pray.", "Her arrow rain doesn't go away on hit which makes it annoying to mash out of with regular buttons. React to it with sweep or U kick.", "Dealing with command jump: 5H > commandjump is punishable with 2H, commandjumps from farther out are better dealt with using 5L. If she does it from far enough away Grimnir doesn't really have any way to challenge. Very difficult to deal with. Try to avoid the spacing where she can jump in like this.", "In neutral, she has a hard time dealing with jump fullscreen - not airdash, just regular jump. Her only air-unblockable antiair is the arrow rain which she generally has to press on prediction. Represent jump around seals a lot to annoy her, run in with 66L when you have her scared of your jump.", "Can throw out ult tornado randomly fullscreen to get lucky with a full combo, low risk and high reward. If she presses her ult arrow instead it wins though so beware.", "Don't tech throws, especially while butterfly is on you. She likes to bait with commandjump or air arrow. Fuzzy mash 5L instead. If you see her do air arrow above you, you can just hold forward to corner swap. Spotdodge works if there's no butterfly, but if there's a butterfly you'll usually die for it.", "She has a very long range sweep that knocks down from any range (why don't we get this? >:[ ). She will randomly press it in neutral to get lucky. Something to keep in mind. She also has an overhead dash attack that you will almost never see, and you'll forget about it around the time she uses it to steal a round. Another thing to keep in mind.", "By far the problem in neutral is butterfly. She can throw out single butterfly basically for free and there isn't really anything we can do to punish her for it - attempting to approach usually results in f.L > death. Navigating around butterfly is key to the matchup. If it's on top of you, you can roll through an arrow she shoots and it will trigger behind you, but if she has 50% be aware that you cannot roll the U arrow. If it's in front of you, you can back up and it will trigger in front of you. Try very hard to position yourself in a way where it does not trigger *on top* of you because this gives her free plus frames.", "U butterfly tracks you somewhat aggressively and stays on hit. Grimnir has better options to run away from it than most characters. Go in the air, run forward, etc. But sometimes you'll be forced to let her detonate it and take free plus frames.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: j.L wins against everything except U DP.", "Throwtech RPS: 2M is a 7f low and beats everything except j.214U.", "Supers: SBA has bad horizontal range, making it a bad reaction super. SSBA is a good reaction super and will beat all forms of tornado. SBA can be spotdodged, SSBA cannot. If you're close, you can roll behind her, or if she doesn't catch you during dash startup it's slow enough that you have time to block."]}
