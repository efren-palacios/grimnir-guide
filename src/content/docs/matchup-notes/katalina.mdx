  notes={["Her charge is an annoying move to deal with. She can't be plus off it, but her buttons are so much better that when spaced she can often stuff an attempt to challenge. When you're near the corner, randomly throwing out H charge is a safe play that can easily lead to a full combo.", "Katalinas will randomly throw out Shield Wall on offense to try and bait BC. If you press BC, you die. If you don't, she broadly has three followups she'll do:", "1) Slash, then backstep. She's minus but far enough away that it can be tough to challenge, especially on reaction.", "2) Slash, then forward step. She is -5 at best and -1 at worst depending on how long she charges. Note that -1 means her throw will beat an attempt to mash 5L, so you have to play the throw RPS.", "3) No slash and backstep. This is extremely punishable, but not on reaction.", "You can sometimes mash to beat her before she has time to do any followup. In particular, Shield Wall only has one point of armor, so f.H's two hits, U tornado's multihit, or just mashing 5L autocombo can all win against delayed followups. If she does it in a blockstring, the slash will generally come out first and beat you, so beware.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Punished by 9f DP.", "Throwtech RPS: 2M is a 7f low and beats all options except j.214U.", "Supers: SBA is a good reaction super that beats all forms of tornado. SSBA's lack of horizontal range makes it much more mediocre. Unfortunately, neither can be spotdodged. You can roll behind SBA, but not SSBA. If she doesn't catch you during dash startup, you can block SSBA (but not SBA). It's annoying to remember."]}
