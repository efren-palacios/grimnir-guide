  notes={["You can see her next item below her meter. The main ones to watch out for are star, cannonball, and spike ball which all give her more plus frames on block than usual.", "The high metal projectile beats airdash but can be ducked. The low one loses to airdash and cannot be rolled.", "The main problem in the matchup is mouseball. It is very active, can snipe us out of airdash, and can loop plus frames in the corner. Instant roll will beat it at pretty much all spacings, but if you try to react you will lose.", "66L: Goes under airdash.", "Airdash on block: j.L wins against everything except U DP.", "Throwtech RPS: Because of a strange hitbox interaction, her f.M crushes 2M but loses to f.L.", "Supers: Both of her reaction supers are excellent. SBA in particular will pretty much always give cinematic. Be careful what you press when she has the bar. Both can be spotdodged."]}
