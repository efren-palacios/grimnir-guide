  notes={["Don't press EX seals in neutral until she burns her EX pillar cooldown. Once she burns pillar cooldown, our fireball is good for zoning her out, but don't waste too much time because you do want to get in. Be ready to dodge U pillar.", "If she tries to buff raw in neutral you can punish with 214U, but if she hides behind her U ball there's nothing we can do. Weirdly, our EX fireball beats her EX fireball. If you block ball while she has stock, she can do a stomp followup to grab free plus frames, but most Versusias would rather have the stock than be in so I think you won't see this often.", "If she backs off while you're in the corner she's going to press lariat raw, 100%, be ready. M and H lariat (the two that end in uppercut) are both punishable if she doesn't have stock. U, unfortunately, is not.", "She can spend stock to command jump off her weird diagonal antiair laser. This is a safejump. Don't DP. You can fuzzy mash her landing, though. It can also crossup if she's close so be ready to hold block button.", "Her 2L is +3. It is one of the best buttons in the game. She generally has access to a lot of plus frames, especially with stock, so plan to block for awhile. She'll have to do the same on our turn.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular.", "Throwtech RPS: 2U is an omnipotent throw tech button. Unless you initiate the throw spaced, you don't even have time to walk back and whiff punish. Gotta hold it.", "Supers: She has excellent reaction supers so beware pressing tornado once she has 100 meter. SBA always gets cinematic, but can lose to stop fireball from far ranges. SSBA always wins but only gets cinematic up close."]}
