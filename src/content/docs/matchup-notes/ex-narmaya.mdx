  notes={["The most changed of the three EX characters currently in the game. She loses her iconic stance mechanic entirely, instead mixing features of both stances into a single moveset.", "Her M somersault slash is +1 on block but leaves her awkwardly spaced. This is a spacing trap - you can mash out and beat most options with f.H, but if she presses 5L instead she'll counterhit for a full combo. You can microwait to try and whiff-punish her 5L, but this gives her time to walk back out of range of f.H and whiff-punish the first hit. Basically, you have no choice but to play RPS around this move. The other variants of this special are minus, including the U one which is -6 (punishable with 2M).", "5U is setsuna (regular Narm's slash projectile). She can't hold it, but she *can* angle it upwards. Revolutionary. This actually makes it a little more difficult for us to deal with since we can no longer reliably go over it.", "Her weird stepping slash thing is a straightforward poke special, safe when spaced.", "Her DP is a typical DP. M has invuln and is 9f. Unlike regular Narm, there's no need to fear a parry or guardpoint on any of them - she only has the normal DP.", "She loses flip entirely, so no air specials, and no need to worry about our antiair getting baited by j.214U.", "66L: Goes under airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular.", "Throwtech RPS: Her 2U low-profiles f.H and leaves her +19(!!), but it loses to 2M, f.L, j.214M, or waiting and whiff-punishing.", "Supers: Same as regular Narmaya."]}
