  notes={["His wallcling lunge attack is completely projectile-invulnerable and plus on block, and gives a full combo on hit. Do not press stop tornado in this matchup. If you spotdodge it early enough you can punish. If you spotdodge too late you'll actually be minus so beware. The U variant is invulnerable from frame 6 so you might see him try to press it as a reversal. Spotdodge it too.", "His rekka has four followups.", "- Up kick. Doesn't give him anything, but it's safe.", "- Claw slam. Frametraps and wallbounces, but it's punishable on block so you'll mostly only see it in combos.", "- Overhead kick. Does not need to be blocked high despite the visual. This one is plus; you're expected to mash him out of it. There's a fuzzy mash timing that beats this but doesn't lose to claw slam. Worth learning.", "- Backdash. Not safe, but not punishable on reaction either; if you want to hard call it out, you can punish with 66L.", "- He can also just not do a followup and stop early. He is punishable, but the threat of a followup can scare you out of actually hitting the punish.", "You'll note that there's no real mix here. Fuzzy mashing 5L will at worst leave you safe, though if he backdashes you won't be favored either.", "The most annoying part of the matchup is his EX fireball. It's fast and works as a decent throwbait. On defense/in blockstrings, you can roll it on prediction for a full punish. But the projectile is very slow and has a very awkward angle, so it's difficult to deal with in neutral. Generally, expect to give up screenspace to this move a lot.", "He has a second projectile where he sends a shadow clone of himself forward. Two variants; in the first variant, it's just a projectile. In the second variant, he actually sends himself forward, and will teleport to the clone on block or on hit. This is plus on block, and off some setups he can sideswap with it, so remember to hold the block button. If he sends himself forward, you can hit him out of it with any button or your own projectile.", "He also has a parry and cannot be safely safejumped. None of his reversals are safe to grab, though his ultimate wallcling lunge can kill you if you don't grab early enough so going for grab can be a little spooky in this matchup.", "The most common U skill you'll see from him is U rekka, which isn't a rekka at all. It is fast and advances very far so Seox players like to throw it out randomly. However it doesn't lead to exceptional reward on hit - just some damage and a hard knockdown, no combo - and it's minus on block, so it isn't as matchup-warping as many other similar U skills. If you block it while you're in the corner you can punish with throw.", "His U air special is a divekick. It's plus on block, but quite slow and very punishable on spotdodge.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Has a parry.", "Throwtech RPS: His 2M and 2U will both beat our 2M/f.H if pressed instantly, but neither button reaches, so they both lose to delay 2M.", "Supers: His SBA is an okay reaction super. It will beat all tornado followups if cancelled into from about f.M range, but the horizontal is bad so it whiffs if we cancel from f.H instead. His SSBA is an excellent reaction super. Both can be spotdodged."]}
