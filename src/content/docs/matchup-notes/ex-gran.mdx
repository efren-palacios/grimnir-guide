  notes={["EX characters can be selected by pressing RB (controller) while hovering them. They're alternate versions. Think of them as new characters - you'll need to learn the matchups separately. In my experience they're also way way less popular than the default versions, so you'll hardly ever fight them, making it pretty hard to commit any of the matchup knowledge to memory. >:(", "EX Gran's big knowledge check is his jumping slash special. The M and H versions are plus! You should spotdodge them - you'll almost always be plus, though if you do the latest possible spotdodge on the M version you can be -2. Notably you are never punishable for spotdodging any variant, so don't be afraid to spotdodge when you see it start up.", "The U jumping slash is also plus on block - however, we are ALWAYS plus on spotdodge. Spotdodge it!", "His goofy-looking lunging kick special is similar to regular Gran's boot - punishable pointblank, plus when spaced. Treat it the same way.", "The stab specials are all -12 and punishable from any spacing, except U stab which is plus (but can be spotdodged).", "His fireball becomes shortrange, kind of like Djeeta's U fireball. Only the EX variant is meaingfully plus.", "Buttons are all the same as regular Gran, including the +1-on-block 2M.", "He loses his DP special. Instead, 5U is his meterless DP for some reason. It's 12f so he can't punish airdash on block with it anymore. His metered DP is U kick.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular.", "Throwtech RPS: Same as regular Gran.", "Supers: Same as regular Gran."]}
