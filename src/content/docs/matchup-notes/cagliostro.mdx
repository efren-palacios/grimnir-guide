  notes={["Be ready to react to teleport in neutral and on your offense. If she's in the air, keep your 2H ready. If she's on the ground be ready to 5L.", "If she whiffs spear fullscreen you can punish with 214U on reaction. Cags autopilot this a lot for some reason.", "On our defense, she'll often either press rock (this is plus) or M spear (this is even). Dealing with looping rock pressure on defense is very hard because you cannot mash or spotdodge it on reaction. You can spotdodge on prediction, then try and mash on the 66L pressure reset; or you can U tornado on prediction and lose to spear followup instead. If you have a seal nearby you can jump the rock on reaction to escape instead.", "M spear RPS: M spear pushes you toward her and the framedata is even. If you're close enough for f.L, there is basically no RPS - press f.L and you'll at worst clash with anything she does except reversal. If you're out of range of f.L, she can delay her button to whiffpunish f.L. In this case you either need to press something slower (which loses to f.L) or delay a button (which beats f.L but can lose to something slower).", "She might also try to set up EX traps in her blockstring. You can react to the flash with sweep. Even if you miss the punish, you'll destroy the traps, and she's often far enough that she can't punish on block.", "Don't tech throws against this character, including fuzzy mash - if you press anything, you can lose to EX air teleport. But it whiffs on crouch block, so if you just downback, you can stand up and 5L after she reappears to full punish on reaction.", "On offense, if you give her space she's likely to try to either set up U trap or teleport out. U trap is spotdodgeable on reaction. Be ready to antiair the teleport, or just don't give her space to breathe and you won't have to worry about it.", "Don't spotdodge rock at fullscreen in neutral. You get punished on dodge with spear.", "Cag has a lot of different air options and you'll see them all.", "- Air teleport to teleport above you, or away from you. Can punish her teleporting above you with 2H. If she teleports away, there isn't a whole lot you can do safely because she can do a second option after.", "- Air ult teleport drops a big castle on you and gives a full combo on counterhit. It used to be really toxic, but it got nerfed and now you don't see it that much. The main things to be aware of: it's plus on block, and it often sideswaps, so make sure you hold the block button. If you spotdodge it you get a full punish when she reappears. You can also often antiair her before she disappears.", "- U air trap set puts a really really big trap on the screen. It can be spotdodged on reaction.", "- She can also charge rock to airstall for a bit. If you sneak under or behind her, you get a full punish when she lands. U kick can be a decent way to do this; if she doesn't airstall, you snipe her with the kick, and if she does you slide behind her. Can also catch her with U tornado on the way down.", "When she has traps near you, she gets a full combo with throw. This is the only time her offense is really threatening. There's a very scary second layer: if she has an air trap above you, she can combo off her DP. The strike/throw between these two options is horrifying and there is no great way to deal with it. Guess and get lucky.", "66L: Goes under airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular.", "Throwtech RPS: Her 2M and 2U are both omnipotent throwtech buttons. Can only walk back and whiff punish if you initiate the throw spaced. If you want to be very unhinged, 2U is -3 on spotdodge.", "Supers: Both SBA and SSBA are respectable reaction supers that beat all forms of tornado. SSBA can be spotdodged, SBA cannot. SBA is particularly strong in the clash situation (which she can force somewhat often with M spear)."]}
