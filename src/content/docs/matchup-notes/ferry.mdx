  notes={["Her antiair situation is pretty bad because a lot of her options are air-blockable, so represent neutral jump. If she stays on the ground, set seals and jump around. If she jumps, stay on the ground and snipe with tornado.", "Her setplay may feel like a pure 50/50 (or worse!), but remember that the cat disappears on block. Don't forget to represent mash/DP against her mix - don't let her mix you for free, represent the second layer. When in doubt take the high, it's lower reward. Also be aware that she can potentially combo off both throw and her reactable dash overhead.", "Be careful spotdodging the blue flash in neutral. Spotdodge is great against the blue whip throw, but blue cat will beat spotdodge and you'll die.", "If the Ferry is being predictable, you can roll the whip throw. You get a punish from much farther away than you think - a stark contrast to the Metera matchup. Good Ferries won't be predictable, and roll is a very risky option, so don't count on it too much. It isn't bad to represent it though, because representing it can trick Ferries into charging M whip, which CAN be rolled safely on reaction as soon as you see them holding it.", "66L: Goes under airdash.", "Airdash on block: j.L wins against everything except U DP.", "Throwtech RPS: At min range, 2M clashes with f.L, but our own f.L wins. Don't ask me why.", "Supers: Her SSBA is a mediocre reaction super. It will often go through push tornado, but tends to lose to every other tornado followup (including no followup). It can be spotdodged.", "Her SBA is the ball. It isn't a reversal super; you'll usually see her press it in neutral or after she knocks you down. If you sit there and block honestly, she will get several mixups off the single ball. It is very very difficult not to get hit at all. Some options:", "- The ball bounces in the same arc every time. A common counterplay is to try and sneak under it after the first bounce. Grimnir doesn't have great options for this. You can try 214M or 214U, or if you have seals you can ground dash in.", "- If you BC while the ball is on you, it will usually punish you. However, if you manage to knock Ferry away, she can't follow up and you'll only take a little bit of damage for it.", "- You can usually escape the ball with DP.", "- If you have a lot of screen space to work with, you can aggressively run away.", "- Definitely don't jump.", "She also has an install. You won't see it very often. The main advantage it gives her is the ability to combo off her rising j.L without setplay."]}
