  notes={["Be careful antiairing her when she has meter because U flip will beat 2H. Can be safer to go for an air-to-air instead or just hold it. If she does U flip, react with 5L for a punish.", "Try to be aware of what stance she's in. Her blue stance DP is a parry and cannot be safejumped. Her pink stance DP is 9f and punishes airdash on block. It also recovers super quickly for a DP, so it can be annoying to punish.", "This is a matchup where you have to hold blockbutton - if she does the grounded sideswap attack and you're holding it you get a full punish. If she tries to sideswap with EX flip you have three options: 1) predict it and press 2H (this reaction is quite difficult), 2) react and press U DP, 3) react and press c.M, which often trades but the trade is in our favor.", "When setting up EX tornado, beware that her dash special > followup slashes can hit through the tornado and punish. This trade is typically in her favor. When setting stop tornado against her on offense in the corner beware that it loses to U transient (the grounded dash teleport move).", "Spotdodge U fireball. Spotdodge U transient for a full punish. Delay 5L on U flip.", "66L: Goes under airdash.", "Airdash on block: Blue stance DP is a parry. Pink stance DP is 9f and punishes.", "Throwtech RPS: Be aware of her current stance. Pink stance is the default throwtech situation. In blue stance, her 2M crushes ours and ducks f.H, but it doesn't reach so it loses to delay 2M. Her 2U loses to our 2M at min range, wins any farther out, but it also whiffs if you wait.", "Supers: SBA weirdly does not give a safejump, so don't fuzzy mash on her landing! She's plus and you'll die. SSBA is a very good reaction super. SBA can be spotdodged, SSBA cannot, but if you're close you can roll behind her, or just block if she didn't catch you during the very beginning of your dash."]}
