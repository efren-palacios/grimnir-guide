  notes={["Addressing the elephant early: her air options are obnoxious. Everyone hates them. It isn't just you. She can doublejump, she can airstall, and she has a gigantic j.H with good speed that also hits crossup. It's annoying. But Grimnir is better situated to antiair her than most characters.", "- Unless you are certain it will hit, do not 2H! It isn't nearly as good at hitting her out of the air as it looks.", "- 623M is pretty good. It can get crushed by j.H so you can't press it if she's low to the ground, but if you react early, or as soon as you see the doublejump or airstall, she's a sitting duck. This leads to a full combo on hit from the heights that it tends to work at.", "- j.214L is also okay, but it also gets crushed by her air normals and rarely does anything that 623M doesn't so I wouldn't recommend it. Reward on hit is also much lower. Favor 623M as your antiair in this matchup.", "- If she jumps fullscreen, you can try to snipe her out of the air with up tornado. This is a good option, but only works if she's far away, and the tornado hitbox is smaller than it looks so it's hard.", "- You can also just opt to walk forward and take the screenspace.", "Most characters don't get to interact with 2B when she's in the air *at all*, so having 623M to hit her is a huge privilege in this matchup and we should be very thankful for it.", "In neutral, you'll see her represent four main options.", "- Laser. Doesn't really do anything. Just block it. Whatever.", "- Chain. If you block this, she pulls herself to you and she is plus. You can spotdodge it on reaction. The annoying part is that it phases through other projectiles. You should not press stop tornado in this matchup.", "- Run toward you. Her run has a long startup, but accelerates to be quite fast. She can run in and 5M you, or she can cancel it early with 5H to catch your attempts to check her. This is the problem option. If you see her start running fullscreen, you can try to slap her with tornado, but beware of the next option:", "- Jump. I've already noted that we have good options to deal with jump, but those only apply when she's above us. If she jumps in from a run she's often more horizontal and can beat our attempts to antiair.", "Your goal should be to push her toward the corner. When she's near the corner, she loses the ability to run at you and force this horizontal jump spacing, so you can much more reliably antiair her.", "She ironically doesn't have a good way to deal with airdash so the threat of seals/install can force her to do really stupid jumps in neutral; against a lot of 2Bs you can just jump around on top of your seals and bait a good response.", "If you lose neutral, defense is pretty difficult.", "- The machinegun she fires at the ground is minus on block. If they're in 5M/66L range that's a good option since she can't do anything to stop us. More commonly she's spaced; she might press 2M or 5M to try and beat our 66L. f.H can beat these (her 2M whiffs and her 5M gets crushed), but it comes with the obvious risks of pressing f.H.", "- If she does the laser and she's spaced it's even; the risk/reward here is in her favor so imo it's best to just keep blocking and let her spend her skill bar, but for the common options: f.H beats her pressing M and 66L beats her pressing H.", "- Her baseball bat is plus if she hits the drone. You can roll the drone and then she's minus, but she can hold the baseball bat and punish you on the dodge so it's risky. She can reset pressure forever so you'll need to choose a place to mash eventually.", "- She can cancel a normal into run. This is reactable, but it's a difficult reaction - it costs her a lot of skill meter, so it isn't terrible to just let her do it.", "- The special where she jumps up and throws a bomb at the ground is reactable, and this is another place our Grimnir privilege reve als itself - you can punish on reaction with j.M > j.214M. This is a good throwbait for her as well which leads to a full combo on hit, so be careful teching throws against her.", "- Her dodge/parry can bait BC and punish you. Low reward on hit, but you're still stuck on defense and you're down a bravery point so it's bad for you. There are very few safe places to BC in this matchup.", "- On safejump, she has a \"high/low\" where she does her airstall very low to the ground and then hits you with an aerial. This is fake! If you fuzzy mash 5L you will hit her out of it for free. Don't let 2Bs get away with being idiots for free. Fuzzy mash 5L on the safejumps.", "- She also has that special where she puts the tracking robot thing on you. While this is active she cannot use any other specials. The scary part is that she gets a full combo out of throw. Beware.", "The saving grace on defense is that her damage is very poor, so we get a lot of chances to guess right.", "She has a parry. It looks a lot like a backdash. If you trigger it, your move is treated as a whiff, and she can either do a 5f followup or cancel into a regular button. Off medium-speed buttons such as f.M, she only gets the 5f punish, which doesn't hurt that much. Off f.H she gets a full combo so beware. She can't punish lights, or 2M. The parry has a decently long recovery, but the visual tell is weird and she moves backward so it can be difficult to punish.", "2B's U skills aren't super notable. The big one she has is the drone that drops balls on you that win neutral instantly on block. If she does this in neutral, you can react with U kick for a full punish, though this is risky if she does her U laser instead. If you want to be safe you can roll on reaction instead. Don't spotdodge!", "66L: She doesn't really have a 66L. Her 5L and 5M will both lose to airdash.", "Airdash on block: j.L wins against everything except U DP.", "Throwtech RPS: Her 2M is an omnipotent throwtech button. You can walk back and whiff punish with 2M.", "Supers: SBA and SSBA are both decent reaction supers and will beat tornado. Spotdodge SBA twice. Only need to spotdodge SSBA once.", "She also has an alternate SSBA where she self-destructs, the \"booty install.\" It's unblockable. There's a timer above her head. Spotdodge it when it gets close to 0. Anything below, like, 0.2~0.3 will work."]}
