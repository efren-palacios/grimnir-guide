  notes={["Don't press pokes in neutral because she can go under all of them. Stop tornado can check Riding Free. When she has delta clock never press dash or backdash - play patient. Don't walk too much because EX Riding Free isn't reactable - represent downback regularly.", "Dealing with divekick: H divekick can be rolled pointblank. You're minus, but you swap corner. M divekick... can technically be 2Hed! But it can be a difficult reaction. Safer to roll this too. If she does either while spaced (frequent in neutral), it cannot be rolled - your only choice to avoid giving her free plus frames is 2H. All divekicks (except U divekick) can also be punished on reaction with DP or super. There isn't really a whole lot we can do about U divekick. Even in neutral, you can't really punish it with 2H, and you're minus on spotdodge. DP/Super is about the only play.", "H and U riding free are lows that both lead to full combos on hit when she's low on health, or after she's landed a command grab. Beatrix players WILL throw this out randomly in neutral or on defense and hope to get lucky. If you block it, you get a full punish with 2M > 236H~8. Basically, Beatrix players will consistently press this to gamble with their life, and you must be ready for the gamble.", "Speaking of, she also has a command grab. Keep in mind fuzzy jump/fuzzy backdash as a defensive option in this matchup.", "She can reset pressure with M fireball, but it's much easier to react with sweep than it looks, and it will pretty much always knock down. Outside of autocombo EX can be spotdodged, but often not on reaction, so only do it if they're getting predictable. She also likes to randomly throw out U fireball in neutral, but she doesn't get much reward on hit so it isn't that scary.", "66L: Goes under airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular.", "Throwtech RPS: 2U beats both 2M and f.H. Can delay 2M to beat it.", "Supers: Can both be dodged. Her SSBA is an extremely good reaction super. You can't press tornado while she has it."]}
