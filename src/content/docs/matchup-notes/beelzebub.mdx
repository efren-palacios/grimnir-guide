  notes={["hopeless", "He has three fireball variants. All can be charged for more plus frames. If he charges on offense, you can hit him out of it, probably with sweep. But if he releases you die instead so it's risky. Alternatively if you roll fireball at the perfect time you can get a punish, but the timing is very difficult. In neutral, all forms of fireball (except U fireball) can be reacted to with our U fireball > U kick for a full combo. It is worth saving meter for this. The matchup becomes much less miserable when we have the 75 to threaten this.", "Divekick is also very difficult for Grimnir to deal with. In neutral, you can sometimes beat it with M DP, especially when he's high. If you have super, you can use it to close out the round, but it might not be worth pressing if it doesn't kill. At more horizontal angles or on defense, it's very very difficult for Grimnir to deal with. It's a very strong throwbait and counterpoke for him.", "Fuzzy mash 5L can sometimes beat the throwbait. There isn't a great way to beat counterpoke divekick, though - it's typically too horizontal for M DP, and 2H clearly doesn't win. U divekick can be spotdodged on reaction for a full punish; the other variants generally leave him plus on spotdodge. It's also a very strong option for him on throwtech.", "His weird big swing special is minus in every form, but it leaves him awkwardly spaced where he can stuff attempts to challenge. It's also a multihit low. Beelzebub players like to do two hits of autocombo, then either the autocombo high or the multihit low. It can't be fuzzy blocked (if you move high, you get clipped for a full combo) so you need to actively react to autocombo high (or just take it).", "His vacuum orb is plus on block and eats (non-ultimate) projectiles. You can roll behind him for a punish. The light and heavy variants suck early. The medium variant has a suck delay, so if you roll too early you can die. You can also U tornado on reaction if you don't want to worry about screwing up the timing.", "The ultimate vacuum orb is unblockable. You must spotdodge it. If you're in the air you're hit.", "He has a teleport. If you leave him enough corner space he might try to teleport out. It's punishable, but it's a reaction check.", "His M DP is very slow. Sounds like a downside and sometimes it is, but the big delay can catch a lot of autopilot offense that would bait regular DPs (especially safejumps) so you need to actively watch for it. As an upside, moves that would normally be punished by traditional DPs are often safe to his M DP. His H and U DPs are more traditional.", "If you block a projectile fullscreen, he can unblockable you with ultimate vacuum orb. You can avoid this fate by bravecountering out of the projectile blockstun (the BC iframes will save you), or by spotdodging the projectile. However if you spotdodge the projectile, he gets a punish with his other fullscreen ult skill. For this reason, avoid sitting at fullscreen in this matchup - if you're 75% of the screen or closer and roll toward him to avoid fireballs, he can't set this up on you. If you have the 50% meter for U fireball you can lock down this option for him entirely.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular. Beware that he can command grab super, and it wins unless you're holding up when you land. Backdash is not fast enough.", "Throwtech RPS: 2M is an omnipotent throwtech button. Can walk back and whiff punish with 2M.", "Supers: His SBA and SSBA are both very good reaction supers. Both can be spotdodged.", "He also has a command grab super for some reason. It's 0f post-flash like almost every other command grab super in this game, so if you're on the ground in front of him when you see the animation you're already dead."]}
