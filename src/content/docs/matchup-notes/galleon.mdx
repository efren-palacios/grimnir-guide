  notes={["Spotdodge and jump are very good. You can spotdodge her groundslam/rock fall, but be aware that it's a true blockstring out of her f.H so trying to spotdodge means you'll get hit standing. She can also charge it to make the low hit fullscreen, so don't assume you're perfectly safe just because you're far away.", "If you spotdodge or jump the groundslam on prediction you get a full punish. The move is core to the character so she has to press it eventually. Play RPS around this.", "She has a very slow but long-ranged pressure reset with her M tornado thing. You can mash her out of it, but from the spacing she tends to press it at it's going to be easier to spotdodge or jump.", "Her EX dragon claw is also plus, and very large. Her f.H is large and +0 on block. In general her spaced corner pressure is strong into us.", "Her command grab is the really scary part. If she has her mark on you in the corner, she can combo out of both EX and U command grabs for obscene damage. They are reactable. EX is 21f, U is 12f but with the U skill slowdown it's about the same. If you see her raise her staff above her head, you jump, and she dies. It's a big gamble for her, but it's a very difficult reaction. You can fuzzy forward jump on prediction instead, but obviously this can lose if she baits it.", "She has an aerial divekick command grab. It whiffs on crouchers and has a billion frames of recovery, so if you duck it you can run up and get your best starter.", "She also has an antiair command grab. It's a much better antiair than it looks and will beat any hitbox we put out. We have great ways to bait it with seal dash movement though so it's tough for her to press.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: j.L wins against everything except U DP.", "Throwtech RPS: Default.", "Supers: Her SBA and SSBA are both command grab supers, but uniquely they can both be jumped on reaction. If you aren't committed to a button when you see the cinematic, hold up for a full punish.", "She has an alternate version of her SBA that sends an orb forward. Might invoke your Ferry trauma, but it's garbage by comparison. Roll on reaction for a full punish, jump over it, or just back up and it disappears pretty quickly on its own."]}
