  notes={["Parry character. Can't safejump, favor tornado setup. tk airdash is really good against her projectile. j.214L is a respectable air-to-air.", "Difficult to take oki on midscreen because 66L gets destroyed by parry and anything other than 66L can lose to jumpback U spear. Not bad to adopt a slower gameplan. Her neutral presence isn't that scary.", "Most important knowledge in this matchup is that you can spotdodge after hitting into her regular and EX parries. Always need to be ready for parry on offense. If she does the jump followup (she usually does the jump followup), you are minus after this spotdodge! Do not 2H. But you can punish guaranteed with either DP or super. If she does either of the other followups she is minus.", "Punishing parry on block: the jump followup can be 2Hed. The other two followups are both most consistently punished with f.M. The big horizontal slash followup is actually safe when spaced, which is especially annoying when she does it during her offense.", "You cannot spotdodge after hitting into her U parry, but she doesn't get a full combo off it so it's fair. It is a million times more active than you think it is which makes it a massive pain to punish.", "Another important piece of knowledge: her grounded spear attack has a max of three followups. If she does all three, you can punish guaranteed with U kick. She might also do one or two dashes toward you and then stop - you can't react to this case, you're guessing on how many followups she wants to do, think of it as a rekka.", "The air spear attack also has a max of three followups and if she does all three you can punish with 214U. But unlike the grounded one, if she stops partway it's trivial to react and punish. If you block air spear attack, you should be ready to punish! The only way for it to be safe is if she hits our toes with the first one and doesn't do any followups, but I don't know if I've ever seen that happen in a real match.", "She can throwbait with runup pogo or runup jump spear, but they are both very risky. If you duck pogo, it's a very easy 2H reaction. If she does jump spear and you block she dies.", "On her offense, there are two main things to watch out for: if she's minus, she might press parry which leads to a full combo on hit. If you try to take your turn back, don't buffer a special and be ready to spotdodge. If she's spaced, she might press U fireball. U fireball has a super early hitbox before she fires off the laser itself (9f) that extends way farther forward that you expect. It's a very annoying button for us to deal with on defense. Full combo on hit, leaves her plus on block.", "Also be wary of U laser in neutral. She can follow it up with U spear on hit for a full combo.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Has a parry.", "Throwtech RPS: Mostly default. Be ready to spotdodge parry. 2U beats 2M but loses to f.H.", "Supers: SBA is a decent reaction super that beats all tornado followups. SSBA has poor horizontal range so it usually won't reach. Both can be spotdodged."]}
