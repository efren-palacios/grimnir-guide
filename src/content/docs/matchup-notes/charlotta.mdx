  notes={["Airdash is useless which makes this matchup more annoying than most. Lean hard on tornado in neutral. Be ready to 2H. Block the commandjump low, take the overhead - the grab has much higher reward than the overhead but whiffs on crouchers.", "M ball is punishable anywhere on screen with f.M. H ball is punishable with 2M if you block it in the corner. If you block U ball in the corner she's punishable with throw. Light ball is never punishable. Do not spotdodge any variant! You will die.", "Her light rapid slash special is safe on block, but the other three are plus! The medium one leaves a large enough window to spotdodge, but you don't get much reward on dodge and the risk is very high so it's hard to recommend. On block she's only +1 and pushed quite far away so the situation is pretty even.", "66L: Goes under airdash.", "Airdash on block: Too short to block airdash.", "Throwtech RPS: Default.", "Supers: SBA is a decent reaction super but loses to stop tornado. SSBA is an excellent antiair super. If you're anywhere remotely near her in the air when she presses it, she got you. Be very careful of playing an extended air game while she has it. SBA can be spotdodged, SSBA cannot, but if you try to spotdodge SBA she won't get cinematic, so it's preferable to taking the full hit when you have no other option (e.g. during a dash)."]}
