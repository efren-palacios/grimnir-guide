  notes={["His 2M is large, plus, and hits low. You will see it a lot. Not really any specific counterplay to note here - if he so chooses he can reset pressure forever, so get a good read on your opponent's offensive habits and pick a good place to mash/BC.", "EX fireball is more interactive than it looks. He has three main options.", "1) No followup. Plus when spaced but you can spotdodge. -2 pointblank but it's a true blockstring so he gets the chance to perform a followup for free.", "2) In-place followup. This is very very plus, even pointblank. If he is pointblank you can hit him out of it with 2M. If he is a little farther, you can trade with sweep (this trade is massively in our favor).", "3) The other followups drag the projectile upward. They are both minus.", "He can also reset pressure with the forward followup of his medium projectile. You can roll this on prediction (you're probably minus on reaction), mash, or U tornado to beat it.", "His U fireball is very very plus and gives a full combo on hit, but it's easily spotdodged if you aren't already committed to something. He especially likes it on defense because it's quite fast and doesn't extend a hurtbox, so watch for it when he's halfscreen or so in the corner.", "His U lunging hitgrab is plus on block, can't be spotdodged, and does a lot of chip. You'll see it a lot especially when he's spaced during corner pressure, to try and beat you mashing out. If he tries to do it off something that is only slightly plus, or minus, you can try to hit him out of it with f.M on prediction, but it's risky.", "He has a pseudo-parry where he swaggers toward you with his arms out. In this matchup Belials will mostly look for it against fireball because it has the most recovery. If you hit into him (or your projectile hits into him) he'll teleport above you and come down with a stomp. If you do NOT hit into him, it has a lengthy recovery animation where you get your nastiest punish. If you DO hit into him but recover in time to block, the stomp is -4 and you can punish with throw. You can also 2H it but 2H tends to lose so only do it if you can press very early.", "He has a command grab. All variants are reactable. The H one is the fastest and the one you'll see the most. M is so disastrously slow that if you get hit by it you should just set the controller down, because it clearly wouldn't make a difference at that point. The U grab disguises itself as his pseudo-parry. If you hit into him, he'll do the parry stomp followup (which is still -4 on block). But if he gets close he'll scoop you. You can tell which one it is because it takes away the 50% meter instantly.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular. He can 5U, but it's trivial to react and block for a throw punish.", "Throwtech RPS: 2M is an omnipotent throwtech button. On offense, you can walk back and whiff punish with 2M.", "Supers: SSBA is a decent reaction super that reaches about halfscreen and beats all forms of fireball. SBA is terrible and loses consistently. SSBA can be spotdodged. SBA cannot; if he catches you in dash, you need to roll behind him."]}
