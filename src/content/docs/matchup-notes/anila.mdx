  notes={["Don't try to check her running up, 66H always wins. Don't spotdodge her U skills because U sheep charge will kill you.", "You cannot roll anything she does. The non-ultimate sheep projectiles are spotdodgeable on defense, but you don't get much reward. Framedata ranges from about -2 to +2.", "Her light sheep ride comes out quickly and isn't worth spotdodging. Her medium sheep ride has a fat delay and leaves her +2, but if you spotdodge it correctly you get a full punish. The delay for the spotdodge is somewhat unintuitive and worth practicing. The EX sheep ride is fully punishable on block with f.H.", "She has a followup from sheep ride where she hops off it and throws it as a projectile. If you spotdodge these correctly, she also dies. If she is more than half screen away or so the timing for dodging is the same whether she hops off or not so you don't need to specifically worry about it. If she is close to you in the corner, she can actually punish your spotdodge on reaction. In this case, your only recourse to avoid giving her plus frames is to mash 2M before the charge reaches you. Otherwise, she's plus and you gotta hold it.", "She has a commandjump that can often hop behind you, both in neutral and to escape the corner. It is 2Hable, but can be a pretty difficult reaction. If you have the meter and don't want to worry, you can DP instead. Super can also win, but if she crosses you up it can also go the wrong way.", "The ultimate commandjump goes very far and is plus on block. You can punish on dodge.", "U sheep projectile fires three sheep. If you don't have seals up it's honestly pretty hard to do anything about it. Anila's recovery on this move is very high, so if you DO have seals up, you can tk airdash and punish. It's very difficult to spotdodge from anywhere other than nearly fullscreen, so you'll see Anilas pull it out especially when they're playing for chip. At close range, you need to spotdodge twice almost instantly. It is a difficult reaction.", "Her 5U (the move where she spins her spear in a circle four times) is a 50/50. If she does the followup, you can punish with 2M for a full combo. If she does not do the followup, she is -2, but she can keep her turn by assuming you will wait for the followup. She doesn't really get much reward off this on hit (except corner carry) so favor mashing on it in general.", "66L: Goes under airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular.", "Throwtech RPS: 2M is an omnipotent throwtech button. Walk back and 2M to whiff punish.", "Supers: Her SBA and SSBA are both excellent reaction supers - be careful of pressing tornado in pressure when she has 100 meter. Both can be spotdodged."]}
