  notes={["Starting with the big knowledge check: the stance. She has many options.", "- A quick slash. Plus, but pushes her back a bit.", "- An advancing uppercut. This is minus. When you see it, her turn is over.", "- A low. This is plus, and uniquely can safejab U reversals, so think hard before you wakeup DP.", "- An overhead. This is -6 and can be punished with 2M on block, or 5L if she's pointblank. It isn't reactable, so you're generally guessing between high and low. The low leads to much higher reward on hit, so favor taking the overhead. If it hits spaced and meaty (i.e. on your wakeup, outside of c.L range) it can be safe; Yuel players will often press parry after, so you can wait for an even bigger punish.", "- An advancing charge that is plus when spaced and cannot be spotdodged. Very annoying.", "- A parry. It beats everything except super (and waiting, of course).", "- She can also hop forward to try and reset pressure, throw, or cancel stance.", "The main things you're looking for to escape pressure are her minus advancing uppercut, hop forward, or overhead. Though the hop forward is very fast and difficult to react to. You can hit her out of the advancing charge with tornado or U kick.", "Her non-stance pressure is also strong. She can use Foxflame (the pillar of fire) to reset pressure. The medium and heavy ones are both plus; you can mash out of the medium one, but because its visual tell is very similar to the light one it can be difficult to react to. The visual cue is that for the medium one, she slides forward a little first. If you see this slide forward, mash 2M > 236H~8. U Foxflame is no-strings-attached plus. You can BC, though she can hard read the BC by cancelling into stance parry.", "Her light forward charge move leaves her -3 but spaced awkwardly. f.M will beat any of her meaningful followups here and also catch backwalk, but can lose to stance parry or the fast stance attack. Her reward off both of these is mediocre, so default to challenging with f.M. The medium and heavy variants of this special are both punishable on block. The U version is not, though she is minus. Don't spotdodge it!", "Yuel players will often try to dash jump out of the corner, and often succeed. 2H can hit them even at max height, but if you miss you will eat a full punish so it can be safer to just let them get away with it. She also has an airstall off her jump. She's plus but cannot combo on hit so it isn't especially scary, and 2H can often catch it anyway, but if you want to be sure you can use 623M instead - the forward movement will catch her airstalling.", "Her EX backflip is frame 1 invuln. She can and will use it to backflip out of our midscreen setups. She has three followups:", "- She does a flip forward. This is plus on block.", "- She does a quick low. Has irritatingly far range that will probably catch your attempts to outspace it. Low-profiles attempts to hit her out of the plus-on-block followup. At max range it can be plus, but most often it will be -4 and can be punished with throw.", "- She cancels into stance. Not really punishable, but gives up a lot of screen space.", "If you spotdodge as soon as you see her backflip, you'll be plus against both of her forward-advancing followups.", "The other variants are not invuln frame 1 so you'll see them less. Note that the low followup from the medium version is significantly more minus than usual and can be punished with a real button instead of throw (usually 5L). The U version can be spotdodged for a punish, but be careful because you get punished for spotdodging her other U skill.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Punished by 9f DP.", "Throwtech RPS: 2M is an omnipotent throwtech button, but you can walk back to whiff punish with 2M.", "Supers: SBA will beat all tornado followups except stop tornado. SSBA has no horizontal range but cannot be spotdodged."]}
