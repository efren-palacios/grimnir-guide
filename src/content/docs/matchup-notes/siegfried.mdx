  notes={["Another matchup where his buttons are so much better that it can be tough to find a way in (or out). Fortunately he doesn't have a 9f DP so he has to focus to play around airdash. Don't jump or press tornado when he has 100 meter because he has one of the best reaction supers in the game.", "When you see him enter stance, block high. He doesn't have a low option, but he does have an option that whiffs on crouchers and is very difficult to react to, so taking your turn back after can be difficult if you don't standblock it. Roll and mash beat the majority of his stance options and are good to represent to scare them. Also, the big double slash is unsafe if we block it from close range in the corner - many Siegfrieds will end blockstrings with this, maybe not aware that Grimnir can punish with 2M.", "H fireball can be spotdodged, but M fireball is pretty difficult to deal with on defense. Safest escape for us is U fireball.", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular.", "Throwtech RPS: 2M is another omnipotent throw tech button. Either walk back and delay 2M, or hold it.", "Supers: SBA is one of the best reaction supers in the game and completely warps the matchup whenever he has it. Can't really jump or press any specials while he's at 100. SSBA is also decent but loses to stop tornado. Both can be spotdodged. Siegfrieds that are really looking to let it rip will sometimes get baited by canceling a normal into single seal - you can dodge in time for a full punish.", "Also has an install. It costs him health to activate, but increases his damage a bit and gives him health restore on hit or block. Still not very good, but you'll actually see this install sometimes because it can help Siegfried avoid checkmate chip-death situations."]}
