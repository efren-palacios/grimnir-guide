  notes={["You want to play a more grounded game than normal. Set up either EX seals or a row of ground seals. If he ever presses shield in neutral, you can grounddash in on reaction for a full punish. Can be tempting to press U tornado but he has time to spotdodge and then set up another shield so only do it if you're confident he's going to press something after.", "If he presses U shield he gets a bunch of plus frames but no mix, just hold it.", "If he whiffs his big swing fullscreen in neutral you can punish with 214U. Otherwise be ready to spotdodge, don't roll. Lean more on up tornado than push tornado in neutral because it catches him trying to air swing over it.", "Don't tech throws - fuzzy mash 5L on defense to hit him out of his typical throwbait.", "66L: Goes under airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular.", "Throwtech RPS: His 2M is an omnipotent throwtech button. Only option is to back away and whiffpunish with delay 2M. On defense you have to hold it.", "Supers: SBA is a solid reaction super that beats all forms of tornado. SSBA has mediocre horizontal range and often won't reach. Both can be spotdodged."]}
