  notes={["Has a rekka, but gets no reward off the last hit even on counterhit so it's relatively safe to mash.", "If she has any charge on 5U it's plus. Likes to use it as a throwbait. You can often beat it with fuzzy mash 5L.", "Likes to press U fireball as a throw crush/corner pressure tool, and throw out U rekka randomly in neutral. U fireball leads to a full combo so be careful when challenging in the corner. Also, it's plus on dodge and she can block BC after.", "Midscreen, U rekka doesn't lead to much on hit other than a knockdown, but if it reaches corner she gets a full combo so keep it in mind. If you block it in the corner it's throw punishable.", "Can charge any of her fireballs for enhanced frame data. If you roll a charged fireball during corner pressure you're plus, but be careful of dodging uncharged fireball, because if she charges it instead it'll beat your dodge and you'll die. If you dodge uncharged EX fireball you're not plus enough to safely challenge so you're playing RPS.", "66L: Goes under airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular.", "Throwtech RPS: 2M is a 7f low and beats all options except j.214U.", "Supers: Both can be spotdodged. Like Gran, her SBA will lose to any form of fireball. Unlike Gran, her SSBA is a mediocre reaction super that will whiff past the midrange."]}
