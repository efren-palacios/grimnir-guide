  notes={["Know your seal counterplay.", "- If Grimnir is in the air, crouch and hold block button.", "- You can crouch airdash. If he airdashes above you, stand up and press 5L to punish him.", "- If you block airdash, you can either punish with U DP or clash with 5L, but the timing is difficult so make sure to practice it.", "- You can try to preemptively stuff him with j.L, air ball, or spin, though all these options carry more risk than just crouching the airdash.", "- If he seal dashes directly into you, he's -2.", "- Don't 2H while there is a seal above you because he can kill you for it.", "- If he tries to set up 22H raw in neutral, punish him with U kick.", "- If he places stop tornado, you can either respond by putting up seals, or hit him with U tornado.", "Other than that, know your setups.", "- Fuzzy mash 5L on his safejumps. Don't let Grimnir players get away with fake empty jumps.", "- If you see him do any type of forward or up-forward seal dash while you're in the corner, you can walk forward to cornerswap. Note that if he dashes straight up, he can punish you for this, so only walk forward if you see him do a forward dash.", "- You can sweep the tornado-in-front setup to knock him out of most of his options, though he can hard call it out if you're predictable. You can also press small delay 5L to put him in hit/blockstun long enough to escape the threat of the throw combo. This is much harder for him to call out.", "- The camera 50/50 is reactable. Practice reacting to it in training mode. Block high, react low. You have about 20f to react once you see the top of Grimnir's head.", "- When in doubt, take the throw. Not like he can fuzzy you. :(", "66L: Loses to airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular.", "Throwtech RPS: Default.", "Supers: SBA is a decent reaction super. The super itself is a projectile and will eat other projectiles, but if you're late on the reaction, the projectile can sneak behind the tornado hitbox and hit Grimnir out of the super, so it isn't super reliable. It has a very good antiair hitbox, though Grimnir has many ways to bait it with seals in the mirror. It can be spotdodged pointblank, but from above halfscreen away the tornado will linger long enough to catch you.", "SSBA is a good reaction super that travels a little over half screen and beats all projectiles. If you see a Grim ignorantly pressing tornado you can kill him with this. Can be spotdodged.", "Grimnir also has an install. During install, Grimnir gets six free seal dashes anywhere on screen.", "- Grimnir cannot frametrap install dash into install dash like he can with regular seal dashes; he must wait for the recovery of his current seal dash before he initiates another install dash.", "- If Grimnir is standing on a seal, the seal will be spent instead of his install juice.", "- Install juice drains very slowly over time, so if you hold onto it for long enough you might only get five dashes.", "- You have a very severe meter penalty while in install. If you're in install for awhile, you might build enough for a raging strike > raging chain by the end, but you definitely won't build enough for a U skill.", "- Install does not give you back a BP on activation."]}
