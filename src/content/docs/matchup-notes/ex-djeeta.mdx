  notes={["Her buttons, supers, and DP are all unchanged.", "The jumping axe kick special is plus for all variants except U (which is her metered DP). It broadly can't be spotdodged on reaction, you're minus. You have to either mash it or react with DP/super. Unfortunately this makes it a little difficult for Grimnir to deal with.", "Her L and M stab specials are -6 but unpunishable when spaced. If she does it close for some reason you can punish with 2M. EX stab special is -8 and can always be punished with f.H. U stab special is -4 and unpunishable even in the corner.", "Her fireball is a very regular fireball. She can no longer charge it. Only the EX variant gives meaningful plus frames.", "Her 5U gives her a stock that strengthens her fireball and stab specials, but it doesn't meaningfully change the framedata; be aware of the increased threat but otherwise deal with them as normal.", "66L: Goes under airdash.", "Airdash on block: Regular.", "Throwtech RPS: Same as regular Djeeta.", "Supers: Same as regular Djeeta."]}
