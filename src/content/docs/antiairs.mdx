  videoSrc="/video/midscreen-antiair-meterless-no-corner.mp4"
  description="2H counterhit gives you an extremely easy conversion with stop tornado. This also connects off low non-counterhits, but on high non-counter hits they'll recover before falling into the tornado. Note the weird 623H hit here; you get this if they're high enough, and it leaves them closer for better oki. If you're late on the 5HHH you'll get a clean hit and send them flying instead."

  videoSrc="/video/midscreen-antiair-meterless-reach-corner.mp4"
  description="This 2H counterhit combo tacks on a bit more damage but costs you your seal setup, unless you reach the corner and wallbounce with 214H, where it becomes a no-strings-attached improvement over the previous combo."

  videoSrc="/video/midscreen-antiair-meterless-no-counter.mp4"
  description="As mentioned earlier, low non-counter hits can be converted with stop tornado in the same way as counterhit combos. However off high non-counter hits it's difficult to convert into a full combo without meter. This is a nice consolation combo that gives good carry and mediocre oki."

## Corner Antiairs

<ComboCard
  title="Corner Antiair"
  notation="2H (counterhit) > 236H~4 > 5H > 623H > 5H > 214H > ender"
  videoSrc="/video/corner-antiair.mp4"
  description="Putting 214H as your first special after tornado sometimes bounces the opponent out of the corner, so I recommend using 623H if your cooldowns allow it. Ender is your choice. End in 5H > 22H to set up seals. End in 22U for a safejump setup. End in super to close the round. End in install to BM. The possibilities are endless."

<ComboCard
  title="Corner Antiair But Better"
  notation="2H (counterhit) > 236H~4 > (backwalk)66H > 5H > 623H > 5H > 214H > ender"
  videoSrc="/video/corner-antiair-better.mp4"
  description="The 66H is slightly awkward and pretty much no one actually goes for it in matches, but if you're feeling saucy it's a small optimization."

<ComboCard
  title="Corner Antiair Meterless Safejump"
  notation="2H (counterhit) > 236H~4 > (delay)623H > j.214H > j.22H > j.2U > 5HHH (> j.8U whiff > j.H safejump)"
  videoSrc="/video/corner-antiair-meterless.mp4"
  description="Cool meterless safejump setup if you want to be safe to DP but don't want to spend the meter. Delay the 623H until just as the tornado ends, or the opponent will be too high and drop out of the airball."
/>

<ComboCard
  title="Corner Antiair (No Counterhit)"
  notation="2H > raging strike > (delay)5H > 623H > 5H > 214H > ender"
  videoSrc="/video/corner-antiair-no-counterhit.mp4"
  description="Off low no-counter antiairs you can do the previous combos, but off higher hits the opponent will recover before falling into stop tornado. Midscreen you would convert hits like this with up tornado, but in the corner the up tornado tends to miss, so the best way to stabilize the hit is to just eat the BP loss and use a raging strike."

  notation="2H > 236H~4 > run under > 5H > 623H > 5H > 214H > ender"

  description="Literally the first corner antiair combo but you run under them first."

<ComboCard
  title="Corner Antiair Overhead Reset"
  notation="2H > 236H~8 > reset 66M > 2M > make up the rest"
  videoSrc="/video/antiair-overhead-reset.mp4"
  description="Off corner non-counter hits it's pretty common for the up tornado to miss. You're still very plus on this drop so you can just continue your offense as normal, but if you're feeling evil you can go for an overhead reset. Requires you to be a little out of the corner - if you're right at the corner the tornado goes offscreen and won't connect."
