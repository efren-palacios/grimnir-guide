# Tornado Setups

Note that tornado throw combos were removed in version 2.20. If you see Grimnirs comboing out of throw in videos elsewhere but can't seem to do it yourself, it's because you can't anymore!

<ComboCard
  title="Tornado &quot;Safejump&quot; (Seal Setup)"
  notation="(starter) > 214H > 2M > 623H > j.22H > j.8U > delay j.2U > 5HHH (> 236L~4 whiff)"
  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/tornado-safejump-alt.mp4"
  description="Improved version of the previous setup that tacks on a bit more damage and leaves behind two seals to bait throws, etc. Unfortunately it's somewhat difficult - the timing for the dash pattern is pretty awkward and takes practice."
/>

<ComboCard
  title="Tornado &quot;Safejump&quot; (623H)"
  notation="autocombo > 623H > j.H > rejump j.H > j.214H > j.22H > j.2U > 5HHH (> 214L~4 whiff)"
  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/tornado-safejump-623h.mp4"
  description="Further improved (and fortunately easier) tornado safejump setup that leaves behind *three* seals. The downside of this one is that the starter is more specific."
/>

<ComboCard
  title="Tornado &quot;Safejump&quot; (Metered)"
  notation="autocombo > 214H > 2M > 623H > 22U > 5HHH (> 214L~4 whiff)"
  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/tornado-safejump-metered.mp4"
  description="Excellent and very easy four-seal setup if you're willing to spend the 25%."
/>

<ComboCard
  title="Tornado Overhead (Corner)"
  notation="(starter) > 214H > 2M > 623H > j.22H > j.3U > 8U > j.M > j.1U > 2H (> 236H~8 whiff > 66M"
  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/corner-tornado-overhead.mp4"
  description="Extremely gimmicky overhead combo setup. The overhead is reactable and if it's blocked you die, so don't try this in real matches."
/>

<ComboCard
  title="Tornado Overhead (Midscreen)"
  notation="(starter) > raging strike > raging chain > 22U > 5H > 623L > 9U > (delay) j.3U > 2H (> 236H~8 whiff > 66M)"
  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/midscreen-tornado-overhead.mp4"
  description="Similar concept but midscreen. Similarly kills you if they block. Also much harder to convert because you need the earliest possible 66M."
