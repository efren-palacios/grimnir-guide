import MatchupPage from '../../components/MatchupPage.astro';

An overview of each of Grimnir's matchups, counterplay to their common options, etc. Before we get into character-specific notes I want to give an overview of the Grimnir throwtech situation.

Most characters have two types of button - a button that reaches (usually something like f.M or 2M), and a button that doesn't (usually f.L). Many characters also have a 7f low that beats almost anything we go for - in patch 2.20 we were finally given an option to deal with these in j.214U.
