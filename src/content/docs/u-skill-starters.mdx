<ComboCard
  title="214U starter (reaches corner)"

<ComboCard
  title="236U starter (near corner)"
  notation="236U > 214U > 2H > 623H > 5H > 214H > 5H (> 236L~4 whiff)"

  description="Outside of the corner we no longer get a meaningful combo with 236U, but against people pressing projectile to try and create space out of the corner you can punish into a full combo like this. The 214U > 2H is more stable than it looks."

<ComboCard
  title="22U starter"
  notation="22U > 5HHH > 6U > 5HHH > 6U > 5HHH > 236H > 66L > 2M > raging strike > raging chain > 5H > 623H > 5H > 214H > 5H > raging strike > raging chain > 5H > raging strike > raging chain"
  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/22u-starter.mp4"
  description="You can run up to someone in the corner and press 22U to crush their throwtech attempt. If it hits you do loads of damage. If they block you can cancel into seal dash to keep pressure. May or may not be a bad use of meter but it's really funny when it works. Note that 22U is -6 on block, so if you do it midscreen or don't cancel into dash you're punishable."
