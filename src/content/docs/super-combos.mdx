<ComboCard
  title="Super Combo"
  notation="(starter) > raging strike > 5H > 623H > 5H > 236H~8 > 5H > 214H > super"
  videoSrc="/video/super.mp4"
  description="Your general-purpose &quot;I want to kill you (or get really close)&quot; super combo. If you have technical inputs turned on, make sure to technical input the super for your extra 10%. If you're too far after the raging strike, you'll get far H instead of close H. This still works, but you need to make sure to wait for both hits of f.H or you'll drop. If you're having trouble keeping the height for super, you can replace the 5H before tornado with 2M to make the combo much easier."

<ComboCard
  title="Super With Seals"
  notation="(starter) > 214H > 2M > 236H~8 > 5H > 623H > j.22H > j.6U > j.M > super"
  videoSrc="/video/super-with-seals.mp4"
  description="If you know your super won't kill, you might opt to set up seals instead. You can make this combo significantly easier by doing j.3U > j.H > super instead, but you'll lose the 10% damage bonus for linking a super with technical input. If you aren't using technical inputs there's no downside!"

  description="Slightly stronger super combo if you're close enough to combo out of grounded tornado. The timing on the dash pattern at the end is more difficult than it looks."
