## Midscreen 623L

Grimnir's midscreen combos took a significant hit in the 2.20 patch, so it's more important than ever to learn to make the most of your seals midscreen. These next few combos show ways to convert out of less convenient seal placements.

<ComboCard
  title="623L (reaches corner)"
  notation="(starter) > 623L > 6U > 2M > 236H > run forward > 214H > 623H > j.H > rejump j.H (> j.22H > j.6U whiff > j.M safejump)"
  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/midscreen-623l-reach-corner.mp4"
  description="When you hit your starter but don't quite reach your seal for a gale dash extension, you can use the forward movement from light spin to convert into a full combo. If you think you'll reach the corner with 214H, this sets up for a meterless safejump. Need to eyeball the delay on the 623H based on distance from corner; sending it as early as possible won't let you connect j.H after. If you aren't comfortable with guessing the timing for the safejump, you can just do 5H > 623H > j.22H instead to set up seals. This is preferable to dropping the combo."

<ComboCard
  title="623L (no corner)"
  notation="(starter) > 623L > 6U > 2M > 236H > run forward > 214U > 22X"
  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/midscreen-623l-no-corner.mp4"
  description="If you don't think you'll reach the corner with 214H, you can do this instead to push your opponent Quite Close to the corner and set up seals. Running forward is optional but gives additional corner carry, and honestly it helps with the timing."
/>

<ComboCard
  title="623M (reaches corner)"
  notation="(starter) > 623M > j.3U > 5H > 214H > 623H > j.H > rejump j.H (> j.22H > j.6U whiff > j.M safejump)"
  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/midscreen-623m-reach-corner.mp4"
  description="A similar concept with 623M. Less damage than the 623L route but keeps your tornado cooldown. Generally you don't get the choice of which route you use because it depends where your seals are, but on the rare occasions you do get to choose, that's your tradeoff."

<ComboCard
  title="623M (no corner)"
  notation="(starter) > 623M > j.3U > 5H > 236H~8 > 214U > 22X"

  description="Similar variant if you won't reach the corner with 214H."

## Raging Strike Routes

With the removal of midscreen 214U wallbounce in patch 2.20, Grimnir now needs to rely on raging strike to consistently convert into meaningful combos midscreen. Listed next are a bunch of different options. However, always keep in mind the additional option of "don't do them" - your bravery points are very valuable, and it isn't always worth spending them to convert into a combo. Knowing when to spend and when to save is a skill in itself.

<ComboCard

  notation="(starter) > raging strike > raging chain > 22U > 5H > 623L > 9U > delay j.3U > (walk back) delay 623H (> j.22H)"

  description="Puts the opponent's back against the wall and sets up seals. Great general-purpose option if you want to spend for it. The 623H is slightly awkward but consistent with practice."

## Midscreen 22U

Mostly only works from autocombo starter because other starters have more pushback, so it's pretty rare that you have the opportunity to use one of these in a match. (That's why they're at the bottom of the page where no one will look.)

<ComboCard

  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/22u-corner-to-corner-623l.mp4"
  description="Easy and consistent corner-to-corner seal setup route. Midscreen 22U combos like this cost the full 50% (no refund) since you have to cancel into the special, but if you have the rare opportunity to do this combo it's probably worth it - Grimnir is a much much scarier character when he has seals on you in the corner."

<ComboCard
  title="Midscreen 22U Corner-to-Corner (66L)"
  notation="autocombo > 22U > 66L > 5MM > 6U > 5HH > 6U > 5HHH > 236H~8 > 214U > 2H > 623H > 5H > 214H > 5H > 22H"
  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/22u-corner-to-corner-hard.mp4"
  description="Significantly more damage than the previous combo, but costs 25% more meter, and the 66L is a difficult 2f link. If you're confident in your execution and have the meter to spend you can consider using this."

  videoSrc="/grimnir/video/midscreen-22u-corner-to-corner.mp4"
  description="Pretty difficult combo that can just barely take the enemy corner-to-corner if you execute it perfectly. Note the height after the j.3U - you need about that much height. Any lower and you don't reach corner. Any higher and 214H whiffs. If you're slightly out of the corner it becomes pretty lenient and very solid for the rare opportunities you hit it."
