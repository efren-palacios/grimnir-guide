      description="Grimnir's meterless midscreen conversions are pretty average. Off very distant hits (including most whiff punishes) you can't even connect 214L. If your starter is autocombo, you can end on 214M instead for greater corner carry."

In this case the combo ends after the 214U, and you can either use the knockdown to set up seals or run up and take oki with 66L."

    <h1>Midscreen 623L</h1>
    <p>Grimnir's midscreen combos took a significant hit in the 2.20 patch, so it's more important than ever to learn to make the most of your seals midscreen. These next few combos show ways to convert out of less convenient seal placements.</p>

      description="When you hit your starter but don't quite reach your seal for a gale dash extension, you can use the forward movement from light spin to convert into a full combo. If you think you'll reach the corner with 214H, this sets up for a meterless safejump. Need to eyeball the delay on the 623H based on distance from corner; sending it as early as possible won't let you connect j.H after. If you aren't comfortable with guessing the timing for the safejump, you can just do 5H > 623H > j.22H instead to set up seals. This is preferable to dropping the combo."

    <h1>Raging Strike Routes</h1>
    <p>With the removal of midscreen 214U wallbounce in patch 2.20, Grimnir now needs to rely on raging strike to consistently convert into meaningful combos midscreen. Listed next are a bunch of different options. However, always keep in mind the additional option of "don't do them" - your bravery points are very valuable, and it isn't always worth spending them to convert into a combo. Knowing when to spend and when to save is a skill in itself.</p>
