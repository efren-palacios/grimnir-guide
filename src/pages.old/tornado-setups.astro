    <p>Note that tornado throw combos were removed in version 2.20. If you see Grimnirs comboing out of throw in videos elsewhere but can't seem to do it yourself, it's because you can't anymore!</p>

      description="Not really a safejump, but may as well be: this setup is safe to DP and gives you free plus frames. As a bonus it also works against parry characters. The downsides are that it doesn't set up seals and it does pretty disappointing damage by Grimnir standards, but we can fix these flaws in later routes.<br/><br/>You can spend EX tornado instead, but you're plus either way, so there isn't much reason to blow the cooldown. M tornado is slower and often won't be safe to DP."

      description="Improved version of the previous setup that tacks on a bit more damage and leaves behind two seals to bait throws, etc. Unfortunately it's somewhat difficult - the timing for the dash pattern is pretty awkward and takes practice."
