Really convincing drop feint. 623H and 623M have the same frame data, so you can press 623M if you'd rather keep the cooldown, but there aren't any routes that use 623M this late in the combo so I think it makes the drop look a little more obvious."

You can often get away with this in actual combo drops too, though usually you're quite minus and lose to 2H. This setup is an exception! Fully safe DP &quot;drop.&quot; j.H whiffs if the opponent doesn't perform a ground recovery, but either way you're plus."

      description="You're more likely to see this corner bounce-out happen accidentally after 214H wallbounce. If you realize in time, you can do this to salvage the uncommon drop and keep corner. You also don't need to walk forward for a bad 214H bounce, so it's a little easier to convert in a match. Second video is a way to double-salvage the drop if your 2L doesn't whiff: (5U > crossup j.M). Note that while the first video is a safejump, the second is not!"
